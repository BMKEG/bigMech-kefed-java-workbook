1	All cells were cotransfected with sos1, eps8, and e3b1.
1	(right) Immunoprecipitated sos1.
1	Error bars depict mean ± SEM.
1	We then asked if p66shcWT stimulates the rac1-specific GEF activity of sos1.
1a	With transfection of sos1, eps8, and e3b1, active GTP-rac1 was significantly higher in p66shc +/+ than in −/− MEF (  Fig. 1 A  ).
1a	Moreover, rac1 activity was rescued in p66shc −/− MEF that were reconstituted with full-length wild-type p66shc (p66shcWT) but not in cells expressing the CH2 domain of p66shc (p66shcCH2;  Fig. 1 A  ).
1a	A difference in active rac1 levels between p66shc −/− and +/+ cells was also apparent under basal conditions in which ectopic constructs were not transfected (unpublished data).
1a	These findings show that full-length p66shc activates rac1, whereas its NH  2  -terminal CH2 domain in isolation does not.
1a	In contrast to p66shcWT, expression of p66shcP47A/P50A in p66shc −/− MEF did not rescue rac1 activity (  Fig. 1 A  ) or rac1-specific GEF activity of sos1 (  Fig. 1 B  ), suggesting that proline-mediated interactions play an important role in mediating these functions of p66shc.
1a	Sos1 functions as a ras-specific GEF when bound to grb2 and as a rac1-specific GEF when it is part of the sos1–eps8–e3b1 complex.
1a	We therefore examined the role of p66shc in regulating the formation of these sos1-containing complexes.
1b	With transfection of sos1, eps8, and e3b1, the GEF activity of immunoprecipitated sos1 was twofold greater in lysates from p66shc +/+ than −/− MEF (  Fig. 1 B  ).
1b	Expression of p66shcWT, but not -CH2, in p66shc −/− MEF, restored the rac1-specific GEF activity of sos1 to that in p66shc +/+ MEF.
1b	These findings suggest that p66shc regulates the rac1-specific GEF activity of sos1.
1b	Most SH3 domains bind to proline-rich sequences containing a core XPxXP element (where P = proline, X = hydrophobic residue, and x = any amino acid), with the prolines in the peptide core making direct contact with the hydrophobic pocket of the SH3 domain.
1b	The CH2 domain of p66shc has one putative SH3 binding core element encompassing residues 46–50 (  46  LPPLP  50  ).
1b	We determined the importance of this motif in p66shc-stimulated rac1 activity.
1b	A mutant of p66shc in which prolines 47 and 50 were changed to alanine (p66shcP47A/P50A) was generated.
1b	In contrast to p66shcWT, expression of p66shcP47A/P50A in p66shc −/− MEF did not rescue rac1 activity (  Fig. 1 A  ) or rac1-specific GEF activity of sos1 (  Fig. 1 B  ), suggesting that proline-mediated interactions play an important role in mediating these functions of p66shc.
1b	Sos1 functions as a ras-specific GEF when bound to grb2 and as a rac1-specific GEF when it is part of the sos1–eps8–e3b1 complex.
1b	We therefore examined the role of p66shc in regulating the formation of these sos1-containing complexes.

2	(C) Comparison of sos1–grb2 coprecipitates in HEK 293 with and without p66shcWT overexpression.
2	All cells were cotransfected with sos1 and grb2.
2	(D) Comparison of sos1–grb2 and shc–grb2 coprecipitates in HEK 293 cells transfected with the indicated p66shc construct.
2	All cells were cotransfected with sos1 and grb2.
2	(E) Comparison of shc–grb2 coprecipitates in HEK 293 cells transfected with the indicated p66shc construct.
2	All cells were cotransfected with grb2.
2	Proteins of the shcA family are known to associate with grb2 via phosphotyrosine–SH2 interactions (  Rozakis-Adcock et al., 1993  ;  Gotoh et al., 1996  ).
2	To determine whether such interactions are important to p66shc-stimulated dissociation of sos1 from grb2, tyrosines 349, 350, and 427—the residues on p66shc that when phosphorylated mediate the recruitment of grb2—were mutated, and the capacity of this triple mutant (p66shcY3A) to displace sos1 from grb2 in vivo was examined.
2a	The amount of sos1 associated with eps8 was significantly greater in p66shc +/+ than in −/− MEF (  Fig. 2 A  ).
2a	Reconstitution of p66shcWT in p66shc −/− MEF increased sos1 associated with eps8 (  Fig. 2 A  ) while decreasing sos1 bound to grb2 (  Fig. 2 B  ).
2b	Conversely, the amount of sos1 bound to grb2 was appreciably less in p66shc +/+ MEF than in −/− cells (  Fig. 2 B  ).
2b	Reconstitution of p66shcWT in p66shc −/− MEF increased sos1 associated with eps8 (  Fig. 2 A  ) while decreasing sos1 bound to grb2 (  Fig. 2 B  ).
2c	A similar inverse relationship between p66shc expression and grb2–sos1 binding was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (  Fig. 2 C  ).
2d	When compared with p66shcWT, p66shcY3A expression led to a decrease in displacement of sos1 from grb2 (  Fig. 2 D  ).
2d	In addition, p66shcY3A bound less avidly to grb2 than p66shcWT (  Fig. 2 D  ).
2e	In contrast, the in vivo binding affinity of p66shcP47A/P50A for grb2 was not appreciably diminished when compared with that of p66shcWT (  Fig. 2 E  ).
2e	This indicates that phosphorylation of the targeted tyrosine residues is in part responsible for the binding of p66shc to grb2 and, more important, the consequent displacement of sos1 from grb2.
2e	We were intrigued by the possibility that the same features of the CH2 domain that confer upon p66shc its ability to govern rac1 activity may also determine its ability to regulate oxidative stress.
2e	We therefore assessed the importance of the CH2 domain and prolines 47 and 50 in this domain to p66shc-induced intracellular ROS generation.

3	Error bars depict mean ± SEM.
3	We also looked at the role of e3b1 in the increase in ROS levels induced by p66shc.
3a	Expression of p66shcWT in p66shc −/− MEF resulted in a significant increase in H  2  O  2  , whereas expression of p66shcP47A/P50A or -CH2 had no appreciable effect (  Fig. 3 A  ).
3b	Comparison of H  2  O  2  levels between p66shc +/+ and −/− MEF showed significantly lower levels in the latter, which could be rescued by expression of p66shcWT (  Fig. 3 B  ).
3c	In addition, expression of dominant-inhibitory rac1 (rac1N17) suppressed H  2  O  2  levels to a considerably larger degree in p66shc +/+ MEF than in p66shc −/− cells (  Fig. 3 C  ) and abrogated p66shc-induced rescue of H  2  O  2  levels in p66shc −/− MEF (  Fig. 3 D  ).
3c	Collectively, these findings suggest that rac1-dependent mechanisms play a larger role in regulating H  2  O  2  production in p66shc +/+ than in −/− MEF and that p66shc-mediated rescue of H  2  O  2  levels in p66shc −/− cells is dependent on endogenous rac1 activity.
3d	In addition, expression of dominant-inhibitory rac1 (rac1N17) suppressed H  2  O  2  levels to a considerably larger degree in p66shc +/+ MEF than in p66shc −/− cells (  Fig. 3 C  ) and abrogated p66shc-induced rescue of H  2  O  2  levels in p66shc −/− MEF (  Fig. 3 D  ).
3d	Collectively, these findings suggest that rac1-dependent mechanisms play a larger role in regulating H  2  O  2  production in p66shc +/+ than in −/− MEF and that p66shc-mediated rescue of H  2  O  2  levels in p66shc −/− cells is dependent on endogenous rac1 activity.
3e	P66shcWT overexpressed in a HeLa cell line with constitutive short hairpin RNA–induced down-regulation of e3b1 led to no significant increase in H  2  O  2  , whereas in a control HeLa cell line, overexpression of p66shcWT increased H  2  O  2  levels (  Fig. 3 E  ).
3e	Moreover, as observed in p66shc −/− MEF, expression of p66shcP47A/P50A or -CH2 in control HeLa cells did not significantly increase H  2  O  2  (  Fig. 3 E  ).
3e	These findings suggest that the expression of e3b1 is critical for a p66shc-induced increase in H  2  O  2  .
3e	Grb2 has two SH3 domains.
3e	Because the influence of p66shc on the binding partners of sos1 was dependent on putative SH3 binding proline residues in the CH2 domain, we investigated to determine whether grb2 binds to the CH2 domain via a proline–SH3 interaction.
4	In vitro binding assays using full-length grb2, C-sos1, and p66shcCH2 showed a reciprocal relationship between C-sos1 and p66shcCH2 with respect to binding to grb2 (  Fig. 4, B and C  ).
4	Semiquantitative analysis revealed that C-sos1 bound with much greater affinity to grb2 than did p66shcCH2 (compare  Fig. 4, B and C  ).

4	(C) In vitro binding assay showing displacement of CH2 from grb2 by C-sos1.
4	Increasing amounts (50, 100, 200, and 400 ng) of GST–C-sos1 were added to preformed complex of GST-tagged full-length grb2 (GST-grb2) and hexahistidine-tagged CH2 ([His]6-CH2).

4	(bottom) Expression of grb2 and p66shcCH2 in whole cell lysates.
4	Black lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced.
4	Differential binding affinities of the CH2 domain to the N- and C-SH3 domains of grb2 suggest that p66shc may promote but not be solely responsible for the dissociation of sos1 from grb2.
4	Both the N- and C-SH3 domains of grb2 interact with sos1 (  Yang et al., 1995  ).
4	Therefore, binding of the CH2 domain to the C-SH3 domain of grb2 would be expected to weaken but not entirely abrogate the sos1–grb2 interaction.
4	It is noteworthy that our analysis of the CH2–grb2 interaction was conducted in recombinantly expressed proteins that are not posttranslationally modified.
4	It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that posttranslational modifications of the CH2 domain and/or grb2 may also play an important part in further modulating their interaction.
4	Furthermore, the CH2 domain that was mutated at prolines 47 and 50 did retain some ability to bind to grb2 in vitro, suggesting that other residues may also be important for its interaction with grb2.
4	Although the disparity in active rac1 between the p66shc +/+ and −/− cells was evident under basal conditions, this difference was much more pronounced with the overexpression of sos1, eps8, and e3b1.
4	This might reflect very low levels of endogenous expression of these proteins (particularly eps8 and e3b1) observed in these cell lines (unpublished data), consistent with a predicted mechanism for limiting the formation of the sos1–e3b1–eps8 complex, and regulation of rac1 activity (  Innocenti et al., 2002  ).
4	Notably, although endogenous expression of e3b1 and eps8 was low in both cell lines, p66shc −/− cells had appreciably higher levels of both e3b1 and eps8 when compared with their p66shc +/+ counterparts (unpublished data).
4	This inverse relationship between active rac1 and e3b1/eps8 hints at the possibility of a compensatory feedback mechanism between rac1 and the endogenous proteins that regulate its activity.
4	Overall, our results suggest that the NH  2  -terminal proline-rich CH2 domain of p66shc can bind to the C-SH3 domain of grb2 via a low-affinity proline–SH3 interaction, which, by displacing sos1 from grb2, increases the rac1-specific GEF activity of sos1.
4	These events increase intracellular rac1 activity and H  2  O  2  production.
4	Importantly, this weak proline–SH3 interaction is functionally relevant, only within the context of full-length p66shc.
4	We propose a model in which p66shc binds to grb2 primarily via a well-characterized phosphotyrosine–SH2 interaction.
4a	Full-length grb2 associated with p66shcCH2 in vitro (  Fig. 4 A  ).
4a	In comparison, the binding of p66shcCH2 with mutations at prolines 47 and 50 (p66shcCH2P47A/P50A) to grb2 was much weaker, confirming the importance of these proline residues to this association.
4a	Moreover, comparison of the NH  2  - and COOH-terminal SH3 (N- and C-SH3, respectively) domains of grb2 revealed that p66shcCH2 preferentially bound to the C-SH3 domain, suggesting sequence-specific requirements for the binding of p66shcCH2 to SH3 domains.
4c	Moreover, when compared with p66shcCH2, p66shcCH2P47A/P50A was a much weaker competitor of C-sos1 (  Fig. 4 C  ).
4c	These findings suggest that C-sos1 and p66shcCH2 compete for binding to grb2, with C-sos1 having a significantly higher in vitro binding affinity than p66shcCH2, and that integrity of prolines 47 and 50 within p66shcCH2 is necessary for it to effectively compete with sos1.
4d	In vivo, with overexpression of grb2 and p66shcCH2, there was a weak association between the two proteins (  Fig. 4 D  ).
5	Once p66shc is bound to grb2, its CH2 domain, by virtue of molecular proximity and possibly changes in its conformation, can interact efficiently with the C-SH3 domain of grb2, displacing sos1 from grb2 (  Fig. 5  ).
5	This model predicts that in addition to determining the fraction of cellular sos1 bound to grb2, p66shc may also influence the binding of other proline-rich proteins to grb2 and thereby modulate a variety of cellular functions that are governed by such interactions.
