9	Proposed model for the roles of Sos-1 in the signaling pathway leading to activation of Rac.
9	Under unstimulated conditions (unstimulated), Sos-1-based complexes, PI3K, and the small GTPases, Ras and Rac, are present in the cell in an inactive state.
9	Immediately after stimulation (Stimulated: early events) by growth factor (G.F.), the S/G complex is recruited to the activated RTK at the plasma membrane, leading to Ras activation.
9	GTP-loaded Ras, in turn, mediates signal propagation with the ensuing activation of Rac, through the trimeric complex S/E/E8 (dashed black arrow).
9	In this pathway, PI3K, which binds to GTP-Ras, plays a key role, although it cannot be formally excluded that other Ras effectors may participate in the activation of Rac.
9	Activation of Rac can also be achieved through Ras-independent pathways, among which the one involving the direct recruitment of PI3K to activated RTK (dashed orange arrow).
9	All these pathways converge on the S/E/E8 Rac GEF complex.
9	Activated Rac finally mediates actin remodelling.
9	Concomitantly, activated Ras leads to stimulation of the ERK kinase via the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade (solid red arrow).
9	ERK can phosphorylate Sos-1 (dashed green arrow) with ensuing reduced affinity for Grb2, but not for E3b1.
9	This results (Stimulated: late events) in the disassembly of the RTK-Grb2-Sos-1 complex contributing to the termination of Ras activation.
9	Conversely, the trimeric complex S/E/E8 is stable, thus allowing sustained Rac activation through Ras-independent pathways (dashed orange arrow), which are most likely PI3K dependent, but could also be PI3K dependent.
