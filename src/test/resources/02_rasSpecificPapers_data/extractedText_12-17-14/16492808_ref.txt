1	Our observation that β-Pix binds specifically to Rac1 via its COOH terminus (  Fig. 1  ) suggests that β-Pix mediates the targeting of Rac1 to the membrane.
1a	Streptavidin-based pull-down assays with a series of biotinylated RhoGTPase COOH-terminal peptides using lysates from human embryonal kidney 293 (HEK293) or MDCKII cells confirmed that endogenous β-Pix specifically binds the COOH terminus of Rac1 but not of Rac2, Cdc42, or RhoA (  Fig. 1 A  ).
1a	Moreover, the Rac1 sequence is specific for the β-Pix SH3 domain because the Rac2 or Cdc42 COOH-terminal peptides, which harbor potential SH3 domain–binding motifs, do not bind β-Pix (  Fig. 1 A  ).
1a	To further show that the interaction between β-Pix and Rac1 is independent of the bound nucleotide, we performed pull-down assays with GST or with GST-Rac1 bound to GDP or GTP.
1a	We used COS-7 cell lysates expressing an exchange-deficient β-Pix mutant (  Manser et al., 1998  ) to exclude a potential effect of β-Pix activity on the nucleotide-bound state of Rac1.
1b	In contrast to β-Pix, the Rac GEFs Tiam1 (  Fig. 1 B  ) or Vav2 (not depicted) did not bind the COOH-terminal domain of Rac1.
1b	These data show that the Rac1 COOH terminus binds specifically to β-Pix.
1c	To demonstrate that β-Pix also binds full-length Rac1, we expressed either β-Pix or Rac1 in COS-7 cells and performed reciprocal pull-down assays with bacterially purified GST, GST-Rac1, or GST–β-Pix (  Fig. 1 C  ).
1c	These experiments showed that β-Pix interacts with the full-length Rac1 protein and, conversely, that bacterially purified full-length Rac1 binds β-Pix.
1c	To test whether endogenous Rac1 binds to endogenous β-Pix, we performed pull-down assays with the biotinylated Crib domain of Pak1 (  Price et al., 2003  ).
1c	This domain binds activated Rac from stimulated cells and was used instead of specific anti-Rac1 antibodies because these are directed against the Rac1 COOH terminus.
1c	These experiments were performed with cell lysates derived from cells in suspension or adherent to collagen to induce Rac1 activation (  Price et al., 1998  ).
1d	We found that endogenous β-Pix coprecipitated with the Crib domain of Pak1 in lysates from the adherent cells (i.e., where Rac1 was activated) but not in lysates from the cells in suspension (  Fig. 1 D  ).
1d	The latter finding also excludes the possibility that β-Pix interacts with the Pak-Crib domain directly.
1d	In addition, pull-down assays with GST-Rhotekin or GST–Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, which bind active Rho or Cdc42, respectively, did not show any interaction with β-Pix (not depicted).

2	 The Rac1–β-Pix interaction is mediated via the β-Pix SH3 domain and the Rac1 COOH terminus.
2	 (A) The Rac1–β-Pix interaction is direct and is mediated via the COOH terminus of Rac1.
2	Bacterially purified β-Pix, GST-Rac1, and GST-RacΔC were used in GST pull-down experiments in the presence of control (Ctrl), Rac1 COOH-terminal, or Pak1-Crib peptides.
2	GST-RacΔC does not bind to β-Pix, and the interaction between GST-Rac1 and purified β-Pix is competed only by the COOH-terminal peptide.
2	(B) The Rac1 COOH-terminal proline residues mediate β-Pix binding.
2	Binding of transfected Rac1wt, Rac1 P-A, V12Rac1, or V12Rac1 P-A to GST–β-Pix was analyzed by pull-down (PD) assays followed by Western blotting (WB).
2	(C) The β-Pix SH3 domain mediates binding to Rac1.
2	Bacterially purified GST-Rac1, β-Pix, and β-PixW43K were used in pull-down assays as indicated.
2	(D) The β-Pix SH3 domain is sufficient for Rac1 binding.
2	Pull-down assays were performed with either GST or GST-SH3 in the presence of purified Rac1.
2	(E) Binding of β-Pix to Rac1 is independent of the nucleotide, which is bound to Rac1.
2	COS-7 cells were transfected with a β-PixΔDH mutant, and pull-down assays were performed with GST, GST Rac1-GDP, or GST Rac1-GTPγS.
2	Western blotting was used to detect an association with β-Pix and to detect GST.
2	(F) β-Pix and Rac1 colocalize in FAs and membrane ruffles.
2	HA-Rac1 was expressed in HEK293 cells and detected by immunostaining.
2	Endogenous β-Pix is in green, Rac1 is in red, and colocalization appears in yellow.
2	(G) β-Pix is differentially localized at FAs at the leading edge of polarized cells.
2	NIH3T3 cells were seeded on fibronectin for 18 h, after which they were fixed and stained for endogenous paxillin and β-Pix.
2	Paxillin is in green, β-Pix is in red, and colocalization in the merged images appears in yellow.
2	Arrow indicates the leading edge, and the asterisk indicates the contractile back of the cell.
2	Magnified images of the front, middle, and back of the cell are indicated by the dashed boxes.
2	Bars, 10 μm.
2	The SH3 domain of β-Pix and a proline stretch in Pak1 mediate the Pak–β-Pix association (  Bagrodia et al., 1998  ;  Manser et al., 1998  ).
2	To determine whether the homologous proline stretch in the COOH terminus of Rac1 is required for the interaction with β-Pix, we generated wild-type (WT) and activated Rac1 mutants in which the proline residues at positions 179, 180, and 181 were mutated to alanines (Rac1 P-A).
2	Pull-down experiments with GST–β-Pix in lysates from COS-7 cells expressing either Rac1, Rac1 P-A, V12Rac1, or V12Rac1 P-A show that the P-A mutants no longer interact with β-Pix.
2	β-Pix interacts via its SH3 domain not only with Rac1 (  Fig. 2  ) but also with Pak1 (  Bagrodia et al., 1998  ;  Manser et al., 1998  ).
2	This suggests that Rac1 and Pak1 may compete for β-Pix binding, which could represent a means of regulating Rac1 binding to β-Pix.
2	Therefore, association of the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide with purified GST–β-Pix was analyzed in the presence or absence of purified GST-Pak1.
2a	Indeed, GST-Rac1 but not GST-Rac1ΔC binds to β-Pix (  Fig. 2 A  ).
2a	Moreover, the binding between Rac1 and β-Pix was blocked by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide but not by a control peptide or the Pak1-Crib peptide (  Fig. 2 A  ).
2a	These data show that the interaction between full-length Rac1 and β-Pix is direct and is mediated via the COOH terminus of Rac1 but not via its effector loop.
2b	This confirms that the proline stretch in the COOH terminus of Rac1 is required for the interaction with β-Pix and indicates that the interaction between Rac1 and β-Pix is nucleotide independent (  Fig. 2 B  ).
2b	This interaction is blocked by the COOH-terminal Rac1 peptide (  Fig. 2 B  ), indicating that the β-Pix–RhoGDI interaction is mediated via Rac1.
2b	Of note, the COOH-terminal Rac1 peptide does not bind RhoGDI and does not interfere with the Rac1–RhoGDI interaction (  van Hennik et al., 2003  ; unpublished data).
2b	These data suggest that Rac1 can be targeted to the membrane by β-Pix while in complex with RhoGDI.
2c	Subsequent pull-down experiments with WT GST-Rac1 in the presence of purified β-Pix or of a β-Pix SH3 domain mutant, β-PixW43K (  Bagrodia et al., 1998  ), showed that β-Pix can only bind Rac1 when the SH3 domain of β-Pix is intact (  Fig. 2 C  ).
2d	Moreover, we observed that the isolated β-Pix SH3 domain is sufficient for binding to purified Rac1 (  Fig. 2 D  ).
2d	Together, these findings indicate that the direct interaction of Rac1 with β-Pix is mediated via the proline stretch in the COOH terminus of Rac1 and the SH3 domain of β-Pix.
2e	 Fig. 2 E  shows that this β-Pix mutant binds both the GDP- and the GTP-bound forms of Rac1 to a similar extent, which shows that the Rac1–β-Pix interaction is independent of the Dbl homology (DH) domain of β-Pix and occurs with both inactive and activated Rac1.
2f	To explore the intracellular localization of the Rac1–β-Pix complex, we transfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged Rac1 and seeded these cells on fibronectin for 1 h. Immunostainings for endogenous β-Pix and HA-tagged Rac1 showed that in the basal section of the cell, Rac1 and β-Pix colocalize to FAs (  Manser et al., 1998  ;  Turner et al., 1999  ) particularly at the periphery of the cell (  Fig. 2 F  , basal and zoom).
2f	In the middle section of the cell, the two proteins colocalize markedly at the periphery but not in the center and colocalize most prominently in membrane ruffles (  Fig. 2 F  , middle).
2f	Rac1 is usually localized primarily in the cytosol as a result of its association to RhoGDI.
2f	However, activated Rac1 translocates to the plasma membrane in an integrin-dependent fashion (  del Pozo et al., 2000  ).
2f	In polarized cells, Rac1 activity has been found in the leading edge, which is in line with its function in actin polymerization, cell protrusion, and motility (  Kraynov et al., 2000  ;  Ridley et al., 2003  ).
2f	Given the fact that β-Pix binds Rac1 and, thus, may drive local Rac1 activation, we analyzed β-Pix localization in polarized cells.
2f	For these experiments, we cultured NIH3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 18 h. Cells were fixed and immunostained for endogenous β-Pix and for paxillin, a marker for FAs.
2g	We found that although paxillin is found in FAs both in the leading edge as well as in the contracting rear of polarized cells, β-Pix is concentrated in FAs in the leading edge and is virtually absent from the paxillin-positive FAs in the cell body or in the rear of the cell (  Fig. 2 G  ).
2g	These data suggest that the differential localization of β-Pix in polarized cells drives localized activation of Rac1.

3	 Binding of the COOH terminus of Rac1 to β-Pix is important for β-Pix–mediated Rac activation and membrane ruffling.
3	 (A) β-Pix–mediated Rac1 activation is dependent on the Rac1 COOH terminus.
3	HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector (EV) or β-Pix were seeded on fibronectin for 1 h and incubated with the control (Ctrl) or Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (Rac1 C-term) 15 min before lysis.
3	A Pak1-Crib peptide was used to isolate GTP-loaded Rac1, and total Rac1 and β-Pix were detected by Western blotting.
3	(B) β-Pix–induced membrane ruffling is inhibited by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide.
3	HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP–β-Pix, seeded on fibronectin, and treated with a control peptide, the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide, or a Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide in which the prolines were replaced by alanines (Rac1 C-term P-A).
3	Cells were subsequently fixed and stained for β-Pix (green) and F-actin (red).
3	Arrows indicate membrane ruffles.
3	Bar, 10 μm.
3	(C) The SH3 domain of β-Pix is necessary for β-Pix–mediated Rac1 activation.
3	HEK293 cells expressing β-Pix or β-PixW43K were seeded on fibronectin for 15 min before lysis.
3	A biotinylated Pak1-Crib peptide was used to isolate GTP-loaded Rac1.
3	Total Rac1 and β-Pix were detected by Western blotting.
3	(D) β-Pix mediates adhesion-induced Rac1 activation.
3	MEFs were transfected with control siRNA or β-Pix siRNA, and cells were seeded on fibronectin for 15 min before lysis.
3	Active Rac1 was pulled down with a biotinylated Pak1-Crib peptide.
3	Rac1 and β-Pix were detected by Western blotting.
3a	We found that the exogenous expression of β-Pix resulted in higher levels of active Rac1 in these cells, which was reduced in cells that were incubated with the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (  Fig. 3 A  ).
3a	Importantly, the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide does not interfere with the isolation of activated Rac1 by the Pak1-Crib peptide (  van Hennik et al., 2003  ).
3b	Furthermore, GFP–β-Pix–induced membrane ruffling in HEK293 cells was almost completely inhibited by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide but not by the control peptide or by a Rac1 P-A COOH-terminal peptide (  Fig. 3 B  ), which cannot bind β-Pix (not depicted).
3b	Moreover, expression of the β-PixW43K mutant inhibited Rac1 activation compared with the expression of WT β-Pix, again indicating that the SH3 domain of β-Pix is indispensable for β-Pix–mediated Rac1 activation.
3b	In addition, when β-Pix–expressing cells were kept in suspension, Rac1 was not activated, suggesting that adhesion to an extracellular matrix is required for β-Pix–mediated Rac1 activation (unpublished data).
3b	To further test this, we reduced the levels of β-Pix in mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) using short inhibitory RNA (siRNA) expression and seeded the cells on fibronectin for 15 min, after which the Rac1 activity was assayed.
3d	Indeed, the cells with reduced β-Pix expression also showed reduced Rac1 activity after adhesion (  Fig. 3 D  ), confirming that β-Pix mediates adhesion-induced Rac1 activation.

4	 The Rac1–β-Pix interaction mediates Rac1 targeting to the plasma membrane.
4	 (A) The nongeranylgeranylated V12Rac1C189S mutant is targeted to the plasma membrane in β-Pix–expressing cells.
4	HEK293 cells were transfected with GFPV12Rac1C189S (green) with or without myc–β-Pix (red) and were seeded on fibronectin for 1 h. Cotransfection of β-Pix results in the detection of GFPV12Rac1C189S in membrane ruffles, which is blocked by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (bottom three panels).
4	Bars, 10 μm.
4	(B) Rac1, β-Pix, and RhoGDI can form a trimeric complex.
4	Pull-down experiments were performed with GST or GST–β-Pix in COS-7 cell lysates in the presence of control (Ctrl) or the COOH-terminal Rac1 peptide (Rac1 C-term).
4	RhoGDI and GST–β-Pix were detected by immunoblotting.
4	TCL, total cell lysate.
4	In the cytosol, Rac1 is tightly bound to RhoGDI, and, therefore, it is likely that RhoGDI is either released from Rac1 before Rac1 targeting to the membrane or that Rac1 and RhoGDI are targeted as a complex.
4	Based on structural analysis, it was suggested that the COOH terminus of Rac1 is not required for the interaction of Rac1 with RhoGDI (  Di Poi et al., 2001  ;  Grizot et al., 2001  ).
4	This, in turn, suggests that Rac1 can bind β-Pix through its COOH terminus even when complexed to RhoGDI.
4	In line with this, GST–β-Pix pull-down experiments showed that RhoGDI indeed complexes with β-Pix.
4a	To test this, we used a nonprenylated Rac1 mutant (V12Rac1C189S;  del Pozo et al., 2000  ) that no longer localizes to the plasma membrane but accumulates in the nucleus (  Fig. 4 A  ).
4a	However, when this Rac1 mutant is cotransfected with β-Pix, membrane localization of Rac1 is restored (  Fig. 4 A  ).
4a	Furthermore, the membrane recruitment of V12Rac1C189S by β-Pix is blocked by the cell-permeable Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (  Fig. 4 A  ).
4a	This shows that the Rac1 COOH terminus by itself is not sufficient for the targeting of full-length nonprenylated Rac1 to the plasma membrane but that the interaction with β-Pix is both necessary and sufficient for the membrane targeting of Rac1, even in the absence of a lipid anchor.

5	 (A) The Rac1–paxillin interaction can be inhibited by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide.
5	Pull-down experiments with GST-Rac1 in COS-7 cell lysates was performed in the presence of 100 μg of the indicated peptides.
5	Paxillin was detected by immunoblotting.
5	TCL, total cell lysate.

5	Pull-down (PD) experiments were performed with COS-7 cell lysates using GST-Rac1 or GST-Rac1ΔC.
5	Paxillin and GIT were detected by immunoblotting.
5	(C) Rac1 colocalization with paxillin in spreading cells is dependent on the Rac1 COOH-terminal proline residues.
5	HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged V12Rac1 or V12Rac1 P-A and stained with antibodies to the HA immunotag (green) and to paxillin (red).
5	The boxed areas are magnified in the corresponding bottom panels.
5	(D) Rac1-mediated cell spreading is dependent on the proline stretch in the COOH terminus of Rac1.
5	HEK293 cells stably expressing empty vector (EV), V12Rac1, or V12Rac1 P-A were seeded on fibronectin- or collagen-coated gold electrodes, and resistance was measured for 30 min.
5	 n  = 75 (per line).
5	(E) HEK293 cells stably expressing empty vector, V12Rac1, or V12Rac1 P-A were seeded on collagen dishes and fixed after 30 min.
5	Images were obtained with phase-contrast microscopy.
5	(F) HEK293 transiently expressing V12Rac1 or V12 Rac1 P-A were seeded on collagen for 1 h. Cells were fixed and immunostained for Rac1 (green) and actin (red).
5	Bars, 10 μm.
5	To assess whether the spreading of V12Rac1- or V12Rac1 P-A–expressing cells is quantitatively different, we seeded HEK293 cells expressing either empty vector, V12Rac1, or V12Rac1 P-A on fibronectin or collagen and monitored their spreading by means of electrical cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS;  Schmidt et al., 2003  ).
5	This technique allows real-time analysis of cell spreading on gold electrodes coated with extracellular matrix proteins.
5a	To further establish the Rac1 targeting to a β-Pix–GIT–paxillin complex, we performed GST-Rac1 pull-down experiments with lysates of COS-7 cells and found that endogenous paxillin associates with Rac1 (  Fig. 5 A  ).
5a	This interaction is inhibited by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide but not by the Rac2 COOH-terminal peptide or by a control peptide (  Fig. 5 A  ).
5b	Furthermore, we observed that GST-Rac1ΔC no longer associates with endogenous paxillin or PKL/GIT (  Fig. 5 B  ).
5b	These data indicate that FA targeting of Rac1 is mediated by the β-Pix–GIT–paxillin complex and is dependent on the Rac1 COOH terminus.
5c	In line with this result, we found that V12Rac1 localizes to paxillin-containing FAs in spreading HEK293 cells, which is in contrast to the V12Rac1 P-A mutant (  Fig. 5 C  ).
5c	Interestingly, the distribution of FAs in spreading cells that express V12Rac1 P-A appeared disorganized compared with the cells expressing V12Rac1.
5c	Moreover, the V12Rac1 P-A mutant showed no discrete localization in these cells, suggesting that the targeting of Rac1 to FAs requires their proper organization as well as an intact Rac1 COOH terminus.
5d	V12Rac1-transfected cells spread two- to threefold more efficiently compared with the V12Rac1 P-A mutant or empty vector–transfected cells (  Fig. 5 D  ).
5e	This was confirmed by phase-contrast imaging (  Fig. 5 E  ) as well as by staining for F-actin (  Fig. 5 F  ).
5e	Together, these data show that Rac1 binding to β-Pix is important for Rac1 targeting to FAs and for efficient Rac1-mediated cell spreading on extracellular matrix proteins.
5f	This was confirmed by phase-contrast imaging (  Fig. 5 E  ) as well as by staining for F-actin (  Fig. 5 F  ).
5f	Together, these data show that Rac1 binding to β-Pix is important for Rac1 targeting to FAs and for efficient Rac1-mediated cell spreading on extracellular matrix proteins.

6	Arrows indicate the membrane-targeted V12Rac1C189S.
6	Bars, 10 μm.
6	The competitive binding of Rac1 and Pak1 to β-Pix suggests that in the absence of Pak1, more β-Pix–Rac1 complexes could be formed, resulting in higher levels of activated Rac1.
6	To test this, we used immortalized MEFs that were derived from Pak1-null (Pak1  −/−  ) and WT (Pak  +/+  ) mice and tested the Rac1 activity in these cells after seeding on fibronectin.
6a	The data show that GST–β-Pix directly binds to the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (  Fig. 6 A  , third lane) and that GST-Pak1 inhibits this interaction (  Fig. 6 A  , fourth lane).

6a	It is noteworthy that the Rac1 peptide does not interact with Pak1 (not depicted).
6a	It is noteworthy that the Rac1 peptide does not interact with Pak1 (not depicted).
6b	Furthermore, we found that Pak1ΔCrib, a Pak1 mutant that cannot bind active Rac1 but can associate to the SH3 domain of β-Pix, blocks the interaction between full-length Rac1 and β-Pix (  Fig. 6 B  ).
6b	These data show that Rac1 and Pak1 compete for binding to β-Pix.
6c	We found that there is clearly more activated Rac1 present in the Pak1  −/−  cells compared with the WT cells (  Fig. 6 C  ).
6c	The low but detectable levels of GTP-Cdc42 are similar in the Pak1  −/−  cells versus the WT cells (  Fig. 6 C  ).
6d	Subsequent pull-down assays with the COOH-terminal Rac1 peptide showed that more β-Pix associates to the Rac1 COOH terminus in the Pak1  −/−  cells compared with the WT cells (  Fig. 6 D  ).
6d	This indicates that in the absence of Pak1, there is more β-Pix available for Rac1 binding, resulting in increased Rac1 activation.
6d	The increased levels of activated Rac1 in the Pak1  −/−  cells suggest that these cells will spread more efficiently than the WT cells (  Bishop and Hall, 2000  ).
6d	We tested this by seeding the WT and Pak1  −/−  cells on fibronectin-coated ECIS electrodes.
6e	In agreement with the aforementioned hypothesis, we found that the Pak1  −/−  cells spread more efficiently than the WT cells (  Fig. 6 E  ).
6f	To confirm this, we seeded cells on fibronectin (  Fig. 6 F  ) or collagen (not depicted) and visualized the cells' morphology by phase-contrast microscopy.
6f	The Pak1  −/−  cells did indeed spread more efficiently, forming clearly detectable lamellipodia, whereas most WT cells were round with small membrane extensions (  Fig. 6 F  ).
6g	Furthermore, reconstitution experiments with Pak1 WT or Pak1 P191A and P192A, Pak1 mutants that do not bind β-Pix (  Manser et al., 1998  ), showed that the enhanced spreading of Pak1  −/−  cells can be restored with WT Pak1 but not by the Pix-binding mutant (  Fig. 6 G  ).
6g	These data suggest that Pak1 controls cell spreading by regulating the β-Pix–Rac1 interaction and, as a result, β-Pix–mediated Rac1 activation.
6g	To further confirm this, we reduced the expression of β-Pix by means of siRNA in WT and Pak1  −/−  cells and analyzed their spreading on fibronectin-coated ECIS electrodes.
6h	The enhanced spreading of Pak1  −/−  cells was reduced when β-Pix expression is knocked down (  Fig. 6 H  ).
6h	Similarly, reducing the expression of β-Pix in WT cells also impaired their spreading on fibronectin (  Fig. 6 H  ).
6h	This indicates that β-Pix plays a pivotal role in the enhanced spreading of the Pak1  −/−  and WT cells.
6h	The interaction between Pak1 and β-Pix is negatively regulated by the autophosphorylation of Pak1 (  Zhao et al., 2000a  ;  Mott et al., 2005  ).
6h	Because activated Cdc42 promotes Pak1 autophosphorylation and activation (  Manser et al., 1994  ), Cdc42 could induce the dissociation of Pak1 from β-Pix to allow Rac1–β-Pix binding and targeting of Rac1 to the membrane.
6h	In line with this, we observed that V12Cdc42 induced the translocation of V12Rac1C189S to the plasma membrane.
6i	This confirms that Cdc42 activation promotes Rac1 membrane targeting (  Fig. 6 I  ), which is consistent with the observation that the expression of V12Cdc42 results in the activation of Rac1 (  Nobes and Hall, 1995  ).
7	In conclusion, our data support a model (  Fig. 7  ) in which integrin engagement leads to the activation of Cdc42 in the leading edge of motile cells.
7	Activated Cdc42 will subsequently activate FA-associated Pak1, which is bound to β-Pix.
7	Activated Pak dissociates from β-Pix, allowing Rac1 recruitment to FAs through the β-Pix SH3 domain.
7	This is then followed by Rac1 activation, which will trigger actin polymerization, membrane protrusion, and directional cell migration.

7	 Model for β-Pix–mediated membrane/FA targeting and activation of Rac1.
7	 Activation of Cdc42 at the plasma membrane (PM), e.g., by β-Pix (1), will lead to the activation of Pak1 (2), resulting in its autophosphorylation.
7	Activated Pak1 dissociates from the β-Pix–GIT complex (3), enabling the Rac1–RhoGDI complex to associate with the β-Pix–GIT complex (4).
7	Subsequently, the release of RhoGDI from Rac1 (5) enables the activation of Rac1 by β-Pix (6) and allows Rac1-mediated actin polymerization (7).
