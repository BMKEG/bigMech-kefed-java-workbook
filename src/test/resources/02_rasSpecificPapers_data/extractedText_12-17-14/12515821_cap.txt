1	p85 interacts with Abi1.
1a	(A) Left; lysates (5 mg) from MEFs were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies (ctr, preimmune serum).
1a	Abi1 could also be detected in p85 immunoprecipitates (supplemental materials).
1a	About 1% of total p85 could be found associated with Abi1 immunoprecipitates.
1a	Right; lysates (5 mg; p85 = 0.3 mg) from MEFs were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies (top).
1a	The immunocomplexes were tested for PI3K lipid kinase activity by TLC (bottom; Domin et al., 1996).
1b	(B) Binding of GST-p85 fragments (amino acid boundaries or domains are indicated) to Abi1 from lysates of HA-Abi1–transfected 293T cells.
1b	The altered electrophoretic mobility of the Abi1 band in the 320–724 lane is due its co-migration with the GST-fusion protein.
1c	(C) Lysates (2 mg) from 293T cells transfected with HA-Abi1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody.
1c	Immunoprecipitates, treated with alkaline phosphatase in the presence (+) or absence (−) of inhibitors (API), were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-HA (left) or anti-pY (middle), or analyzed in Far-western with the proteins indicated on the top.
1d	(D) Lysates (1 mg) from 293T cells, transfected with HA-tagged wild-type (WT) or Y407F Abi1, were subjected to in vitro binding with the GST-NH2-terminal SH2 domain of p85 (SH2-N) or GST alone.
1d	Similar results were also obtained using the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of p85, indicating that the apparent affinities of the SH2 domains of p85 for Abi1 were similar (not depicted).
1e	(E) Lysates (5 mg) from Cos-7 cells, transfected with HA-Abi1 (WT) or HA-Abi1Y407F, were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies (ctr, anti-flag antibody used as a control).
2	p85 associates with the Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complex under physiological conditions.
2a	(A) Top; model of the Eps8–Abi1–p85–Sos-1 complex.
2a	Bottom; lysates (10 mg) from −/− [Eps8myc] cells and supplemental materials) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the indicated antibodies (ctr, irrelevant antibody) in the presence of the peptides PPPPPVDYTEDEE (competing) or PPPPPVAATEDEE (control).
2a	Immunoblotting (IB) was performed with the indicated antibodies.
2b	(B) Quiescent (Serum Starved) and PDGF-treated (PDGF) MEFs were fixed and stained with the indicated antibodies.
2b	Confocal analysis was carried and the apical sections are shown.
2b	Notably, colocalization between Abi1 and p85 could be detected only when the apical sections of PDGF-treated cells were analyzed.
2b	In these sections, the increase in the local concentration of the two proteins favors their detection by immunofluorescence, consistent with a notion that a relatively small (but physiologically relevant) pool of p85 is associated with Abi1 and enriched in ruffles.
2b	Arrows indicate dorsal ruffles.
2b	Bar, 10 μm.
3	PI3K recruitment to the Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complex is required for Rac-GEF activity, which is further increased by PIP3.
3a	(A) Cos-7 cells were transfected (tfx) with mycEps8 and Sos-1, together with either Abi1wt (WT) or the Y407F mutant (Y407F).
3a	Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies.
3a	Control immunoprecipitates were obtained using an irrelevant antibody.
3b	(B) Rac-GEF activity was measured in aliquots of the immunoprecipitates shown in A, in the absence or presence of the indicated water-soluble phosphoinositides (Han et al., 1998; supplemental materials).
3b	The difference in the samples marked by the asterisks was significant (P < 0.01) in a paired t test.
3c	(C) Cos-7 cells were transfected (tfx) with mycEps8 and Abi1, together with either Sos-1 (WT) or a dominant-negative mutant of Sos-1 (DH−).
3c	Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies.
3d	(D) Rac-GEF activity was measured on aliquots of the immunoprecipitate containing equal amounts of wild-type Sos-1 and the Sos-1 DH− mutant shown in C, in the absence or presence of the indicated water-soluble phosphoinositides.
3d	The difference in the samples marked by the asterisks was significant (P < 0.005) in a paired t test.
4	p85 is required for Abi1-induced activation of Rac in vivo.
4	Cos-7 cells, transfected (tfx) with HA-Rac together with HA-Abi1, HA-Abi1Y407F, HA-Abi1DY, or the empty vector (ctr) were treated with 100 ng/ml of EGF for 3 min (+) or mock-treated (−).
4	Lysates were either incubated with GST-CRIB and detected with anti-Rac antibodies (RacGTP), or directly immunoblotted with the indicated antibody.
4b	(B) p85α/p85β-double (p85 −/−) and p85β-single (p85 −/− [p85α]) knockout MEFs, transfected (tfx) with HA-Rac together with either an HA-Abi1 (+) vector or the empty vector as control (−), were serum-starved for 24 h. Lysates were incubated with GST-CRIB as described above and detected with anti–HA-Rac antibody (RacGTP) or directly immunoblotted with the indicated antibody.
4c	(C) Cos-7 cells, transfected (tfx) with HA-Rac together with Abi1 (Abi WT) or the empty vector (ctr), were incubated for 1 h with 100 nM of wortmannin (Wort, + lanes) or vehicle (Wort, − lanes), as a control, and treated with EGF (EGF, + lanes) or mock-treated (EGF, − lanes).
4c	Rac-GTP levels, total Rac, and the expression of Abi1 were determined as in A.
5	The Abi1-p85 association is required for ruffling by activated RTK and Ras, but not by activated Rac.
5a	(A) Quiescent MEFs, microinjected with the indicated peptides together with rabbit IgG (supplemental materials), were treated with PDGF for 10 min.
5a	Cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to detect F-actin (red) and anti–rabbit IgG (not depicted) to detect microinjected cells (indicated by asterisks).
5a	More than 100 cells were injected in each experiment.
5a	In the bar graph, a quantitation of the experiment is reported.
5b	(B) MEFs were transfected, as indicated on the top, with expression vectors for either RasV12 or RacQL, together with either ECFP-Abi1WT or ECFP-Abi1Y407F.
