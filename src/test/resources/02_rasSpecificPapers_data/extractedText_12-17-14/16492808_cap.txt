7	Model for β-Pix–mediated membrane/FA targeting and activation of Rac1.
7	Activation of Cdc42 at the plasma membrane (PM), e.g., by β-Pix (1), will lead to the activation of Pak1 (2), resulting in its autophosphorylation.
7	Activated Pak1 dissociates from the β-Pix–GIT complex (3), enabling the Rac1–RhoGDI complex to associate with the β-Pix–GIT complex (4).
7	Subsequently, the release of RhoGDI from Rac1 (5) enables the activation of Rac1 by β-Pix (6) and allows Rac1-mediated actin polymerization (7).
