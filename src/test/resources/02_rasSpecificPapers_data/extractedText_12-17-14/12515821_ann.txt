1A+S1	We searched for interaction(s) of the Eps8?Abi1?Sos-1 com- plex with class I PI3K. Endogenous p85 and Abi1 could be coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 A, left, and supplemental materi- als), and a wortmannin-sensitive (Fig S1, available at http:// www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200206079/DC1) PI3K en- zymatic activity was detected in Abi1 immunocomplexes (Fig. 1 A, right), suggesting that the p110?p85 complex binds to Abi1.
1B	GST-p85 or either of its SH2 domains could bind to Abi1 (Fig. 1 B) and to various pTyr-containing proteins, one of which co-migrated with Abi1 (unpublished data).
1C	Indeed,  as previously reported, tyrosine phosphoryla- tion of Abi1 was readily detectable (Juang and Hoffmann, 1999 Fan and Goff, 2000) and was abolished by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1 C, left panels and supple- mental materials). Finally, a Far-western analysis revealed that the NH 2 -terminal SH2 of p85 bound directly and spe- cifically to Abi1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). Notably, the recruitment of p85 to Abi1 was in- dependent of RTK activation (unpublished data), in agree- ment with the observation that Abi1 displays constitutive levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (unpublished data).Thus, the possibility that in vivo, the interaction between p85 and Abi1 is indirect, cannot be formally excluded, albeit our Far-western data (Fig. 1 C) argue against it.
1D	This, and the observation that bacterially produced Abi1 (that is not tyrosine phosphorylated) failed to interact with p85 (Fig. S1, D), suggested that the interaction is mediated by pTyr in Abi-1.
1DE	Tyr 407 of Abi1 was predicted by the NetPhos neural net- work (Blom et al., 1999) as a strong candidate for phosphor- ylation by tyrosine kinases (supplemental materials). Muta- tion of Tyr 407 to Phe abrogated the p85?Abi1 interaction both in vitro (Fig. 1 D) and in vivo (Fig. 1 E). The overall tyrosine phosphorylation of Abi1Y407F was not reduced, as compared with wild-type Abi1 (unpublished data). Thus, al- though other tyrosine residues are also phosphorylated in Abi1, Tyr 407 is absolutely critical for the interaction with p85. Of note, Tyr 407 is present in noncanonical context for ligands of the SH2 domains of p85 (Songyang et al., 1993).
2A	To assess whether p85 is associated to the Eps8?Abi1?Sos-1 complex (Fig. 2 A), we used Eps8 / fibroblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored to physiological levels ( / [Eps8myc] cells Scita et al., 2001 Innocenti et al., 2002). Endogenous Sos-1, Abi1, and p85 could be specifi- cally detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A). In addition, the disruption of the Eps8?Abi1 interaction with the specific PPPPPVDYTEDEE peptide (but not with a con- trol, PPPPPVAATEDEE, peptide Mongiovi et al., 1999) caused the disappearance of Abi1, p85, and Sos-1 from the anti-myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A).
2B	Similarly,  endogenous p85 was found to colocalize with Abi1 (Fig. 2 B) and Eps8 (unpublished data) on treatment with PDGF. Thus, p85 is part of an Abi1-based signaling complex that includes Eps8 and Sos-1 in vivo.Finally, the RTK-depen- dent relocalization of the macromolecular complex at sites where membrane ruffling takes place (Fig. 2 B for review see Scita et al., 2001) suggests that the recruitment of the complex to proper sites within the cell?s formation is key for signal propagation, further ensuring that the production of PIP3 is directed to and modulates the activation of Rac- GEFs, and thereby of Rac, in a defined microenvironment.
3A	Cells were transfected with a combination of Sos-1? mycEps8?Abi1wt or Sos-1?mycEps8?Abi1Y407F, and Rac- GEF assays were performed on anti-myc immunoprecipitates. Trimeric Eps8?Abi1?Sos-1 complexes were readily detected that contained similar amounts of the catalytic subunit Sos-1 (Fig. 3 A).
3AB	Endogenous p85 (Fig. 3 A) and Rac-GEF activity (Fig. 3 B) were present only in the complexes containing Abi1wt, but not in those with Abi1Y407F.
3C	Cells were transfected with a combination of mycEps8, Abi1, and either wild-type Sos-1 or Sos-1DH . Sos-1DH associates with the Eps8?Abi1 complex as efficiently as wild-type Sos-1 (Fig. 3 C).
3CD	How- ever, no Rac-GEF activity could be detected in Eps8?Abi1? Sos-1DH immunocomplexes as compared with the Eps8? Abi1?Sos-1 complex under conditions in which equal amounts of wild-type or mutant Sos-1 were present (Fig. 3, C and D).
3D	Moreover, the addition of water-soluble PIP3 in- creased the Rac-GEF of the Eps8?Abi1?Sos-1, but not of the Eps8?Abi?SosDH immunocomplex (Fig. 3 D). Thus, Sos-1 is not only critical for Rac-GEF activity of the Eps8? Abi1?p85?Sos-1 complex, but it is also required to confer responsiveness to PIP3.
4	Thus,    all together, these data supportthe notion that PI3K recruitment to the Eps8?Abi1?Sos-1 complex is physically required to elicit a basal Rac-GEF ac- tivity, which is further increased by PIP3.This is further supported by the finding (Fig. 4) that the overexpression of Abi1 leads to increased Rac-GTP levels, in a p85-dependent manner, even in the absence of growth factor stimulation.
4A	As show in Fig. 4 A, both the basal and the EGF-induced levels of Rac-GTP were increased by the expression of wild-type Abi1, consistent with the notion that Abi1 is rate-limiting in Rac activation (Innocenti et al., 2002). However, no Rac activity could be detected when the Abi1Y407F, or a mutant of Abi1 (Abi1DY), which does not associate with Eps8, were used (Fig. 4 A). These results strongly suggest that Abi1 mutants, defective in their ability to assemble to PI3K or Eps8, are not only biologically inac- tive, but act as dominant-negatives, most likely by sequester- ing the other endogenous components in inactive com- plexes. Moreover, a formal proof of the requirement of p85 for Abi1-dependent activation of Rac was obtained by using fibroblasts in which both p85 isoforms ( and ) were ge- netically removed (unpublished data).
4B	In these cells, expres- sion of Abi1 failed to induce Rac activation, which was, however, restored by reintroduction of p85 (Fig. 4 B).
4C	Fi- nally, treatment with wortmannin reduced (but did not ab- rogate) EGF-dependent and EGF-independent Rac activa- tion induced by Abi1 (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, the Rac-GEF activity in the Eps8?Abi1?p85?Sos-1 immunocomplex was only reduced by pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin (unpublished data).
5B	Second, we cotransfected the activated version of either Ras (RasV12) or Rac (RacQL) together with either Abi1wt or the Abi1Y407F mutant, and scored the formation of ruffles. RasV12- induced (but not RacQL-induced) ruffles were efficiently inhibited by coexpression of Abi1Y407F, but not by Abi1wt (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the recruitment of PI3K by Abi1 plays a critical role in RTK-induced actin remodeling and is essen- tial for the propagation of signals from Ras to Rac.
S2+5A	To analyze the bi- ological consequence of p85 recruitment by the tricomplex, two approaches were undertaken. First, a phosphorylated peptide encompassing Tyr 407 of Abi, and corresponding to the Abi1 binding site of p85, was used. This phosphorylated peptide, but not its unphosphorylated version or one in which the tyrosine residue was replaced by phenylalanine, efficiently inhibited the binding of p85 to Abi1, but not to activated PDGFR (Fig. S2). Microinjection of the phosphor- ylated peptide (but not of the two control peptides) inhib- ited PDGF-induced ruffles by more than 70% (Fig. 5 A).
S3+3B	Con- sistently,  the addition of PI3,4,5P (0.5 M), the catalytic product of PI3K, but not of PI4,5P, PI5P, or PI3P (unpub- lished data and Fig. S3), led to a statistically significant in- crease in the Rac-GEF activity of the Eps8?Abi1wt?Sos-1 complex (Fig. 3 B and supplemental materials). More importantly, it restored the GEF activity of the Eps8?Abi1Y407F?Sos-1 complex (Fig. 3 B). The two events, p85 recruitment and PIP3 availability, might independently in- fluence the Rac-GEF activity of the tricomplex, or might be somehow integrated. Whatever the case, both the physical presence of p85 and the availability of PIP3 seem to partici- pate in the activation of the Rac-GEF activity of the Eps8? Abi1?Sos-1 complex, at least in vitro.
S4+4	Notably,  inhibition of RTK-mediated ruffles could also becaused by microinjection of anti-Abi1 antibodies (Scita et al., 1999 and Fig. S4), which, however, did not affect TPA- induced actin remodeling, indicating that additional path- ways leading to Rac activation (and possibly reflecting the si- multaneous presence of several Rac GEFs in the cells) are at play (supplemental information, Fig. 4).
