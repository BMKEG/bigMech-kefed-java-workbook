1A	To determine whether p66shc can activate rac1,   we compared rac1 activity in mouse embryonic fi broblast (MEF) cell lines derived from mice with targeted knockout of the p66shc gene (p66shc ?/? MEF) with that of their wild-type littermates (p66shc +/+ MEF). With transfection of sos1, eps8, and e3b1, active GTP-rac1 was signifi cantly higher in p66shc +/+ than in ?/? MEF (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, rac1 activity was rescued in p66shc ?/? MEF that were reconstituted with full-length wild- type p66shc (p66shcWT) but not in cells expressing the CH2 domain of p66shc (p66shcCH2 Fig. 1 A). A difference in active rac1 levels between p66shc ?/? and +/+ cells was also appar- ent under basal conditions in which ectopic constructs were nottransfected (unpublished data). These fi ndings show that full- length p66shc activates rac1, whereas its NH2-terminal CH2 domain in isolation does not.
1AB	We determined the im- portance of this motif in p66shc-stimulated rac1 activity. A mutant of p66shc in which prolines 47 and 50 were changed to alanine (p66shcP47A/P50A) was generated. In contrast to p66shcWT, expression of p66shcP47A/P50A in p66shc ?/? MEF did not rescue rac1 activity (Fig. 1 A) or rac1-specifi c GEF activity of sos1 (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that proline-mediated interactions play an important role in mediating these functions of p66shc.
1B	We then asked if p66shcWT stimulates the rac1-specifi c GEF activity of sos1. With transfection of sos1, eps8, and e3b1, the GEF activity of immunoprecipitated sos1 was twofold greater in lysates from p66shc +/+ than ?/? MEF (Fig. 1 B). Expression of p66shcWT, but not -CH2, in p66shc ?/? MEF, restored the rac1-specifi c GEF activity of sos1 to that in p66shc +/+ MEF. These fi ndings suggest that p66shc regulates the rac1-specifi c GEF activity of sos1.
2A	Sos1 functions as a ras-specifi c GEF when bound to grb2 and as a rac1-specifi c GEF when it is part of the sos1?eps8? e3b1 complex. We therefore examined the role of p66shc in regulating the formation of these sos1-containing complexes. The amount of sos1 associated with eps8 was signifi cantly greater in p66shc +/+ than in ?/? MEF (Fig. 2 A).
2AB	Reconstitution of p66shcWT in p66shc ?/? MEF increased sos1 associated with eps8 (Fig. 2 A) while de- creasing sos1 bound to grb2 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, p66shcCH2 and -P47A/P50A led to little or no change in the amounts of grb2 and eps8 bound sos1 (Figs. 2, A and B). Thus, full-length p66shc, via prolines 47 and 50, promotes dissociation of sos1 from grb2 in vivo and increases the formation of the sos1? eps8?e3b1 complex.
2B	Conver- sely, the amount of sos1 bound to grb2 was appreciably less in p66shc +/+ MEF than in ?/? cells (Fig. 2 B).
2C	A similar in- verse relationship between p66shc expression and grb2?sos1 binding was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (Fig. 2 C).
2D	To determine whether such interactions are important to p66shc-stimulated dissociation of sos1 from grb2, tyrosines 349, 350, and 427?the residues on p66shc that when phosphorylated mediate the recruitment of grb2?were mutated, and the capacity of this triple mutant (p66shcY3A) to displace sos1 from grb2 in vivo was examined. When compared with p66shcWT, p66shcY3A expression led to a decrease in displacement of sos1 from grb2 (Fig. 2 D). In ad- dition, p66shcY3A bound less avidly to grb2 than p66shcWT (Fig. 2 D).
2E	In contrast,  the in vivo binding affi nity of p66shcP47A/ P50A for grb2 was not appreciably diminished when comparedwith that of p66shcWT (Fig. 2 E). This indicates that phosphor- ylation of the targeted tyrosine residues is in part responsible for the binding of p66shc to grb2 and, more important, the conse- quent displacement of sos1 from grb2.
3A	We were intrigued by the possibility that the same fea- tures of the CH2 domain that confer upon p66shc its ability to govern rac1 activity may also determine its ability to regulate oxidative stress. We therefore assessed the importance of the CH2 domain and prolines 47 and 50 in this domain to p66shc- induced intracellular ROS generation. Expression of p66shcWT in p66shc ?/? MEF resulted in a signifi cant increase in H2O2, whereas expression of p66shcP47A/P50A or -CH2 had no ap- preciable effect (Fig. 3 A).
3B	Comparison of H2O2 levels between p66shc +/+ and ?/? MEF showed signifi cantly lower levels in the latter, which could be rescued by expression of p66shcWT (Fig. 3 B).
3CD	In addition, expression of dominant-inhibitory rac1 (rac1N17) suppressed H2O2 levels to a considerably larger de- gree in p66shc +/+ MEF than in p66shc ?/? cells (Fig. 3 C) and abrogated p66shc-induced rescue of H2O2 levels in p66shc ?/? MEF (Fig. 3 D). Collectively, these fi ndings suggest that rac1-dependent mechanisms play a larger role in regulating H2O2 production in p66shc +/+ than in ?/? MEF and that p66shc-mediated rescue of H2O2 levels in p66shc ?/? cells is dependent on endogenous rac1 activity.
3E	We also looked at the role of e3b1 in the increase in ROS levels induced by p66shc. P66shcWT overexpressed in a HeLa cell line with constitutive short hairpin RNA?induced down- regulation of e3b1 led to no signifi cant increase in H2O2,  whereas in a control HeLa cell line, overexpression of p66shcWT increased H2O2 levels (Fig. 3 E). Moreover, as observed in p66shc ?/? MEF, expression of p66shcP47A/P50A or -CH2 incontrol HeLa cells did not signifi cantly increase H2O2 (Fig. 3 E). These fi ndings suggest that the expression of e3b1 is critical for a p66shc-induced increase in H2O2.
4A	Grb2 has two SH3 domains. Because the infl uence of p66shc on the binding partners of sos1 was dependent on pu- tative SH3 binding proline residues in the CH2 domain, we investigated to determine whether grb2 binds to the CH2 do- main via a proline?SH3 interaction. Full-length grb2 associ- ated with p66shcCH2 in vitro (Fig. 4 A). In comparison, the binding of p66shcCH2 with mutations at prolines 47 and 50 (p66shcCH2P47A/P50A) to grb2 was much weaker, confi rming the importance of these proline residues to this association. Moreover, comparison of the NH2- and COOH-terminal SH3 (N- and C-SH3, respectively) domains of grb2 revealed that p66shcCH2 preferentially bound to the C-SH3 domain, sug- gesting sequence-specifi c requirements for the binding of p66shcCH2 to SH3 domains.
4BC	In vitro binding assays using full-length grb2, C-sos1, and p66shcCH2 showed a reciprocal relationship between C-sos1 and p66shcCH2 with respect to binding to grb2 (Fig. 4, B and C). Semiquantitative analysis revealed that C-sos1 bound with much greater affi nity to grb2 than did p66shcCH2 (compare Fig. 4, B and C).
4C	Moreover, when compared with p66shcCH2, p66shcCH2P47A/P50A was a much weaker competitor of C-sos1 (Fig. 4 C). These fi nd- ings suggest that C-sos1 and p66shcCH2 compete for bind- ing to grb2, with C-sos1 having a signifi cantly higher in vitro binding affi nity than p66shcCH2, and that integrity of prolines 47 and 50 within p66shcCH2 is necessary for it to effectively compete with sos1.
4D	In vivo, with overexpression of grb2 and p66shcCH2, there was a weak association between the two proteins (Fig. 4 D).
