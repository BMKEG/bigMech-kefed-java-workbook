1A	To this end, we per- formed immunoprecipitation experiments using eps8 / fi- broblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored, to physiological levels, with an expression vector encoding a myc epitope-tagged Eps8 ( / [Eps8myc] cells). We se- lected transfected clones in which the levels of expression of Eps8myc were very similar to those present in wild-type fi- broblasts (Fig. 1 A).
1B	Endogenous Sos-1 and E3b1 could be detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted, but not from eps8 / fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B).
1C	To determine whether E3b1 mediates the interaction be- tween Eps8 and Sos-1,    as it would be expected according to the tricomplex model, we performed coimmunoprecipita- tion experiments under conditions in which the association between Eps8 and E3b1 was disrupted. The binding site of E3b1 to the SH3 domain of Eps8 was previously mapped to the amino acid sequence, PPPPPVDYTEDEE, where the D and the Y residues are critical for efficient binding (Mon- giovi et al., 1999). Thus, a peptide encompassing this region should specifically disrupt the Eps8?E3b1 association. In- deed, no E3b1could be recovered in anti-myc immunopre- cipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted cells, when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess of the competing peptide. The association was, however, preserved when a control peptide, bearing a Y ? A substitution and unable to bind to Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), was used (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, no Sos-1 could be re-covered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the presence of the competing, but not of the control, peptide (Fig. 1 C). Thus, under physiological conditions, the coimmunoprecip- itation of Eps8 and Sos-1 depends on the integrity of the Eps8?E3b1 interaction, pointing to the existence of a physi- ological S/E/E8 complex. It cannot be formally excluded that Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis, thus al- lowing coimmunoprecipitation. However, we have previ- ously demonstrated (Scita et al., 2001) that the three endog- enous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actinstructures. Thus, the sum of our results strongly argues in fa- vor of the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.
2A	To gain insight into this issue,  we initially mapped the region of E3b1 responsible for the interaction with Sos-1 by using a series of deletion mutants of E3b1 fused to glutathione S -transferase (GST). Native Sos-1 could be efficiently recov- ered onto GST-E3b1 full length (Fig. 2 A, amino acids [aa] 2?480). Further mapping revealed that the SH3 domain of E3b1 (aa 416?480) was necessary and sufficient for binding (Fig. 2 A).Al- though we cannot exclude that the NH 2 -terminal region of E3b1?Abi-1 participates in binding, in vivo , we were not able to observe a high-affinity binding surface in that region by in vitro binding experiments (Fig. 2 A Scita et al., 1999).
2BCD+3AB	This hypothesis was validated by a series of experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo. We could demonstrate that ( a) the SH3 of Grb2,  but not of Eps8, efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro (Fig. 2 B) (b) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR, known to constitute a Grb2-SH3 binding site (Li et al.,1993 Cussac et al., 1994), competed equally well the bind- ing of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 (Fig. 2 C) (c) the binding constants of the interac- tion between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar (Fig. 2 D) (d) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of GST-E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 (Fig. 3 A) and (e) overex- pression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunopre- cipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Sos-1 binds either E3b1 or Grb2, in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that two distinct pools of Sos-1 exist in the cells.
2BCD+4ABC	To test this possibility in vivo, we set out to perturb the equilibrium between the Sos-1?E3b1 (S/E) and Sos-1? Grb2 (S/G) complexes, by increasing the levels of E3b1 within the cell. If the two complexes are functionally dis- tinct, then the overexpression of E3b1, by competing the S/G interaction, should result in (a) reduced Sos-1 recruit- ment in vivo to active EGFR, (b) consequent reduction in Ras activation, as measured by reduced Ras-GTP levels, (c) reduced activation of Ras-dependent pathways, as mea- sured by activation of MAPK, and finally (d) reduced pro- liferative response. All of these predictions were confirmed experimentally (Fig. 4, A?C).
2D	Weshowed that BIAcore measurements revealed similar kinetic parameters for the SH3-mediated S/G and S/E interactions (Fig. 2 D).
5A	However, when we measured the relative abun- dance of S/G and S/E complexes within the cell, we found a 10-fold excess of the former (Fig. 5 A), under conditions in which quantitative immunoprecipitation of the adaptor mole- cules, Grb2 and E3b1, was achieved (Fig. 5 A). Thus, the data indicate that two pools of Sos-1, associated with different adaptors, exist simultaneously in the cell. They further suggest that the pool of E3b1, available for binding to Sos-1, is re- duced relative to that of Grb2, and may be rate-limiting.
5B	In- deed,   overexpression of E3b1 resulted in increased PAK65 ac- tivity, an indicator of Rac activation (Manser et al., 1994) (Fig. 5 B), which was abrogated by a dominant negative Rac mutant (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, overexpression of Sos-1did not lead to increased PAK65 activity. An additional corol- lary of this hypothesis is that the overexpression of E3b1, by facilitating the formation of a trimeric complex with Eps8 and Sos-1, should directly lead to activation of Rac.
5C	To test this prediction E3b1 or a mutant of E3b1 (E3b1-DY), bearing alanine substitutions of the DY residues critical for the inter- action with Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), were used to infect wild-type and eps8 / fibroblasts. The levels of GTP-bound Rac were then determined by in vitro binding assays using the immobilized CRIB domain of PAK65 (Manser et al., 1994). E3b1, but not the E3b1 mutant impaired in Eps8 binding, caused a readily detectable increase in Rac-GTP levels in wild type, but not in eps8 / fibroblasts (Fig. 5 C). Thus, the over- expression of E3b1 is sufficient to activate Rac and this effect is strictly dependent on Eps8 .
6	Thus,  one might predict that a mutant of E3b1 unable to associate to Eps8 should function as a dominant negative on Ras-induced Rac-dependent ruf- fling. To test this, we cotransfected the activated versions of either Ras or Rac, together with E3b1 or the E3b1DY mu- tant. RasV12-induced, but not RacQL-induced, ruffles wereefficiently inhibited by the coexpression of E3b1DY, but not of E3b1 wild type (Fig. 6), supporting the contention that the ability of E3b1 to form a complex with Eps8 is required to transmit signals from Ras to Rac. In conclusion, our data show that two pools of Sos-1 exist in the cell, coupled respec- tively to Grb2 or E3b1. In addition, the availability of E3b1, but not of Sos-1, is indispensable and rate limiting in the pathway leading to Rac activation.
7A	Cells were transfected witheither Sos-1 alone (SosTfx) or a combination of S/E/E8 (Triple Tfx) (Fig. 7 A).Of note, little E3b1 and no Eps8 could be detected in Sos-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7 A).
7AB	We then used the Triple Tfx and coimmunoprecipitated Sos-1 with anti-Eps8 anti- bodies (Fig. 7, A and B).
7B	When Sos-1 was immunoprecipi- tated from SosTfx,   it displayed Ras-GEF, but not Rac-GEF, activity (Fig. 7 B).Despite lower levels of Sos-1 in the coimmunoprecipitate (with respect to a Sos-1 immuno- precipitate from SosTfx), Rac-GEF activity was now present (Fig. 7 B). Conversely, no Ras-GEF activity could be de- tected (Fig. 7 B). The lack of Ras-GEF activity was not due to the low levels of Sos-1. To prove this point, we immuno- precipitated from SosTfx an amount of Sos-1 comparable to that present in anti-Eps8 immunoprecipitates from Triple Tfx (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes SosTfx1/10). Under these condi- tions, Ras-GEF activity was readily detectable (Fig. 7 B).
7C	Purified and nucleotide depleted,  GST-Rac and GST-Cdc42 proteins were therefore used to test their ability to interact with Sos-1. Native Sos-1, present in lysates of / [Eps8myc] fibroblasts, could be specifically recov- ered with nucleotide-depleted immobilized GST-Rac, but not with GST-Cdc42 or GST alone (Fig. 7 C). Conversely, no Sos-1 could be recovered with GST-Rac from lysates ofeps8 / cells. Thus, Eps8 is required for the association be- tween Sos-1 and nucleotide-free Rac. Furthermore, under conditions in which the Eps8?E3b1 or the E3b1?Sos-1 in- teractions were disrupted by specifically competing peptides, a reduction of 80% in the amount of Sos-1 bound to nu- cleotide-depleted Rac was observed (Fig. 7 C). This latter re- sult strongly suggests that an intact S/E/E8 complex is re- quired for binding to Rac, providing a molecular basis for the catalytic specificity of the complex.
8AB	We therefore looked for evidence of differential regulation of the S/G and S/E complex upon RTK stimulation. Upon PDGF stimulation,  we observed decreased coimmunopre- cipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 and consequently be- tween PDGFR and Sos-1 (Fig. 8, A and B), which corre- lated with the appearance of a mobility-retarded form of Sos-1.Con- versely, under identical conditions, the coimmunoprecipita- tion between E3b1 and Sos-1 was not affected (Fig. 8 A).
8C	Similarly,  the stability of the endogenous trimeric complex, Sos-1/Eps8/E3b1 was not affected by treatment of cells with growth factors (Fig. 8 C).The above data indicate that, as a consequence of activa- tion of RTKs, the S/G complex is disrupted, whereas the S/E/E8 complex persists in the cell. This might lead to a transient peak in Ras activity vis a vis a more prolonged acti- vation of Rac.
8D	Therefore, we measured the kinetic of RTK- induced activation of Ras and Rac. As shown in Fig. 8 D, ac- tivation of Ras was rapid and short lived, whereas activation of Rac was sustained over a longer period of time, compati- ble with the differential regulation of the corresponding acti- vating complexes, S/G and S/E/E8.
f7A	(A) Cos-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for Sos-1 (SosTfx) or for Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 (TripleTfx) or with the corresponding empty vectors (mock). Total cellular lysates (100 g, left), or immunoprecipitates (IP, right) with the antibody indicated on the top (ctr, irrelevant antibody), were immunoblotted (WB) with the indicated antibody. 5 mg of total cellular lysates were used for the immunoprecipitations, except in the SosTfx 1/10 lanes, in which 0.5 mg were used.
f7B	(B) Ras-GEF (empty bars) and Rac-GEF (closed bars) activities in aliquots of the same immunoprecipitates (IP) shown in B. Data are expressed as described in Material and methods.
f7C	(C) Immo- bilized, purified GST-Rac (Rac) and GST-Cdc42 (Cdc42) were depleted of guanine nucleotide by extensive washing in 10 mM EDTA as described in Material and methods. Equal amounts of the nucleotide-free GST-GTPases or GST alone (GST) were incubated with total cellular lysates from eps8 / fibroblasts ( / ) or eps8 / stably expressing Eps8myc ( / [Eps8myc]) in the presence or ab- sence ( ) of the 40 ng/ml of the indicated peptides (peptides). The peptide used were PPPPPPVDATEDEE (PXXDA), used as control (see text and Fig. 1) PPPPPVDYTEDEE (PXXDY), which corresponds to the E3b1 binding site for the SH3 domain of Eps8 and prevents Eps8-E3b1 association (refer to Fig. 1 B) VPVPPPVPPRRR (PXXP), which corresponds to the Sos-1 binding site for the SH3 domain of E3b1 and readily competes the interaction between Sos-1 and E3b1 (refer to Fig. 2 C). Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Detection was with anti?Sos-1 antibody (Sos-1). The indicted lanes (lysate) were loaded with 50 g of total cellular lysates.
