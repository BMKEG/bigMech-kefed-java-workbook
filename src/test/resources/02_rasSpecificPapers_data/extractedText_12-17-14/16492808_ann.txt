1	Our observation that ?-Pix binds specifi cally to Rac1 via its COOH terminus (Fig. 1) suggests that ?-Pix mediates the targeting of Rac1 to the membrane.
1A	Streptavidin-based pull-down assays with a series of biotinylated RhoGTPase COOH-terminal peptides using ly- sates from human embryonal kidney 293 (HEK293) or MDCKII cells confi rmed that endogenous ?-Pix specifi cally binds the COOH terminus of Rac1 but not of Rac2,  Cdc42, or RhoA (Fig. 1 A).Together, these fi ndings indicate that the direct interaction of Rac1 with ?-Pix is mediated via the proline stretch in the COOH terminus of Rac1 and the SH3 domain of ?-Pix. Moreover, the Rac1 se- quence is specifi c for the ?-Pix SH3 domain because the Rac2 or Cdc42 COOH-terminal peptides, which harbor potential SH3 domain?binding motifs, do not bind ?-Pix (Fig. 1 A).
1B	In contrast to ?-Pix, the Rac GEFs Tiam1 (Fig. 1 B) or Vav2 (not depicted) did not bind the COOH-terminal domain of Rac1. These data show that the Rac1 COOH terminus binds specifi cally to ?-Pix.
1C	To demonstrate that ?-Pix also binds full-length Rac1, we expressed either ?-Pix or Rac1 in COS-7 cells and performed reciprocal pull-down assays with bacterially purifi ed GST, GST- Rac1, or GST??-Pix (Fig. 1 C). These experiments showed that ?-Pix interacts with the full-length Rac1 protein and, con- versely, that bacterially purifi ed full-length Rac1 binds ?-Pix.
1D	To test whether endogenous Rac1 binds to endogenous ?-Pix,  we performed pull-down assays with the biotinylated Crib domain of Pak1 (Price et al., 2003). This domain binds activated Rac from stimulated cells and was used instead of specifi c anti-Rac1 antibodies because these are directed against the Rac1 COOH terminus. These experiments were performed with cell lysates derived from cells in suspension or adherent tocollagen to induce Rac1 activation (Price et al., 1998). We found that endogenous ?-Pix coprecipitated with the Crib domain of Pak1 in lysates from the adherent cells (i.e., where Rac1 was activated) but not in lysates from the cells in suspension (Fig. 1 D). The latter fi nding also excludes the possibility that ?-Pix interacts with the Pak-Crib domain directly. In addition, pull- down assays with GST-Rhotekin or GST?Wiskott-Aldrich syn- drome protein, which bind active Rho or Cdc42, respectively, did not show any interaction with ?-Pix (not depicted).
2A	To further characterize the Rac1??-Pix interaction, we per- formed pull-down assays with purifi ed GST-Rac1, GST-Rac1?C (a Rac1 COOH-terminal deletion mutant Haeusler et al., 2003), and purifi ed ?-Pix in the absence or presence of the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide or, as a control, the Pak-Crib peptide. Indeed, GST-Rac1 but not GST-Rac1?C binds to ?-Pix (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the binding between Rac1 and ?-Pix was blocked by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide but not by a control peptide or the Pak1-Crib peptide (Fig. 2 A). These data show that the interaction between full-length Rac1 and ?-Pix is direct and is mediated via the COOH terminus of Rac1 but not via its effector loop.
2B	To determine whether the homologous proline stretch in the COOH terminus of Rac1 is required for the interaction with ?-Pix,  we generated wild-type (WT) and activated Rac1 mutants in which the proline residues at posi- tions 179, 180, and 181 were mutated to alanines (Rac1 P-A). Pull-down experiments with GST??-Pix in lysates from COS-7 cells expressing either Rac1, Rac1 P-A, V12Rac1, or V12Rac1 P-A show that the P-A mutants no longer interact with ?-Pix. This confi rms that the proline stretch in the COOH terminus of Rac1 is required for the interaction with ?-Pix and indicates that the interaction between Rac1 and ?-Pix is nucleotide inde- pendent (Fig. 2 B).In line with this, GST??-Pix pull-down experiments showed that RhoGDI indeed complexes with ?-Pix. This interaction is blocked by the COOH-terminal Rac1 peptide (Fig. 2 B), indi- cating that the ?-Pix?RhoGDI interaction is mediated via Rac1.
2C	Subsequent pull-down experiments with WT GST-Rac1 in the presence of purifi ed ?-Pix or of a ?-Pix SH3 domain mu- tant, ?-PixW43K (Bagrodia et al., 1998), showed that ?-Pix can only bind Rac1 when the SH3 domain of ?-Pix is intact (Fig. 2 C).
2D	Moreover, we observed that the isolated ?-Pix SH3 domain is suffi cient for binding to purifi ed Rac1 (Fig. 2 D).
2E	To further show that the interaction between ?-Pix and Rac1 is independent of the bound nucleotide,  we performed pull-down assays with GST or with GST-Rac1 bound to GDP or GTP. We used COS-7 cell lysates expressing an exchange- defi cient ?-Pix mutant (Manser et al., 1998) to exclude a poten- tial effect of ?-Pix activity on the nucleotide-bound state ofRac1. Fig. 2 E shows that this ?-Pix mutant binds both the GDP- and the GTP-bound forms of Rac1 to a similar extent, which shows that the Rac1??-Pix interaction is independent of the Dbl homology (DH) domain of ?-Pix and occurs with both inactive and activated Rac1.
2F	To explore the intracellular localization of the Rac1??-Pix complex, we transfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged Rac1 and seeded these cells on fi bronectin for 1 h. Immunostainings for endogenous ?-Pix and HA-tagged Rac1 showed that in the basal section of the cell, Rac1 and ?-Pix colocalize to FAs (Manser et al., 1998 Turner et al., 1999) particularly at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 2 F, basal and zoom). In the middle section of the cell, the two proteins colocalize markedly at the periphery but not in the center and colocalize most prominently in membrane ruffl es (Fig. 2 F, middle).
2G	Given the fact that ?-Pix binds Rac1 and, thus, may drive local Rac1 activation, we analyzed ?-Pix localization in polarized cells. For these experiments, we cultured NIH3T3 cells on fi bronectin-coated coverslips for 18 h. Cells were fi xed and immunostained for endogenous ?-Pix and for paxillin, a marker for FAs. We found that although paxillin is found in FAs both in the leading edge as well as in the contracting rear of polarized cells, ?-Pix is concentrated in FAs in the leading edge and is virtually absent from the paxillin-positive FAs in the cell body or in the rear of the cell (Fig. 2 G). These data suggest that the differential localization of ?-Pix in polarized cells drives localized activa- tion of Rac1.
3A	We found that the exogenous expression of ?-Pix resulted in higher levels of active Rac1 in these cells, which was reduced in cells that were incubated with the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (Fig. 3 A).
3B	Furthermore,  GFP??-Pix?induced membrane ruffl ing in HEK293 cells was almost completely inhibited by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide but not by the control peptide or by a Rac1 P-A COOH-terminal peptide (Fig. 3 B), which cannot bind ?-Pix (not depicted). Moreover, expression of the ?- PixW43K mutant inhibited Rac1 activation compared with the expression of WT ?-Pix, again indicatingthat the SH3 domain of ?-Pix is indispensable for ?-Pix? mediated Rac1 activation. In addition, when ?-Pix?expressing cells were kept in suspension, Rac1 was not activated, suggest- ing that adhesion to an extracellular matrix is required for ?-Pix?mediated Rac1 activation (unpublished data).
3D	To further test this, we reduced the levels of ?-Pix in mouse embryonal fi broblasts (MEFs) using short inhibitory RNA (siRNA) expres- sion and seeded the cells on fi bronectin for 15 min, after which the Rac1 activity was assayed. Indeed, the cells with reduced ?-Pix expression also showed reduced Rac1 activity after adhe- sion (Fig. 3 D), confi rming that ?-Pix mediates adhesion-induced Rac1 activation.
4A	To test this,    we used a non-prenylated Rac1 mutant (V12Rac1C189S del Pozo et al., 2000) that no longer localizes to the plasma membrane but accumu- lates in the nucleus (Fig. 4 A). However, when this Rac1 mutant is cotransfected with ?-Pix, membrane localization of Rac1 is restored (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, the membrane recruitment of V12Rac1C189S by ?-Pix is blocked by the cell-permeable Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (Fig. 4 A). This shows that the Rac1 COOH terminus by itself is not suffi cient for the targeting of full-length nonprenylated Rac1 to the plasma membrane but that the interaction with ?-Pix is both necessary and suffi cientfor the membrane targeting of Rac1, even in the absence of a lipid anchor.
5A	To further establish the Rac1 targeting to a ?-Pix?GIT?paxillin complex, we performed GST-Rac1 pull-down experiments with lysates of COS-7 cells and found that endogenous paxillin asso- ciates with Rac1 (Fig. 5 A). This interaction is inhibited by the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide but not by the Rac2 COOH- terminal peptide or by a control peptide (Fig. 5 A).
5B	Furthermore, we observed that GST-Rac1?C no longer associates with endo- genous paxillin or PKL/GIT (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that FA targeting of Rac1 is mediated by the ?-Pix?GIT?paxillin complex and is dependent on the Rac1 COOH terminus.
5C	In line with this result, we found that V12Rac1 localizes to paxillin- containing FAs in spreading HEK293 cells, which is in contrast to the V12Rac1 P-A mutant (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, the distri- bution of FAs in spreading cells that express V12Rac1 P-A appeared disorganized compared with the cells expressing V12Rac1. Moreover, the V12Rac1 P-A mutant showed no dis- crete localization in these cells, suggesting that the targeting of Rac1 to FAs requires their proper organization as well as an in- tact Rac1 COOH terminus.
5D	To assess whether the spreading of V12Rac1- or V12Rac1 P-A?expressing cells is quantitatively different, we seeded HEK293 cells expressing either empty vector, V12Rac1, or V12Rac1 P-A on fi bronectin or collagen and monitored their spreading by means of electrical cell substrate impedance sens- ing (ECIS Schmidt et al., 2003). This technique allows real- time analysis of cell spreading on gold electrodes coated with extracellular matrix proteins. V12Rac1-transfected cells spread two- to threefold more effi ciently compared with the V12Rac1 P-A mutant or empty vector?transfected cells (Fig. 5 D).
5EF	This was confi rmed by phase-contrast imaging (Fig. 5 E) as well as by staining for F-actin (Fig. 5 F).
6A	Therefore, association of the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide with purifi ed GST??-Pix was analyzed in the presence or absence of purifi ed GST-Pak1. The data show that GST??-Pix directly binds to the Rac1 COOH-terminal peptide (Fig. 6 A, third lane) and that GST-Pak1 inhibits this interaction (Fig. 6 A, fourth lane). It is noteworthy that the Rac1 peptide does not interact with Pak1 (not depicted).
6B	Furthermore,  we found thatPak1?Crib, a Pak1 mutant that cannot bind active Rac1 but can associate to the SH3 domain of ?-Pix, blocks the interaction be- tween full-length Rac1 and ?-Pix (Fig. 6 B). These data show that Rac1 and Pak1 compete for binding to ?-Pix.
6C	The competitive binding of Rac1 and Pak1 to ?-Pix sug- gests that in the absence of Pak1, more ?-Pix?Rac1 complexes could be formed, resulting in higher levels of activated Rac1. To test this, we used immortalized MEFs that were derived from Pak1-null (Pak1?/?) and WT (Pak+/+) mice and tested the Rac1 activity in these cells after seeding on fi bronectin. We found that there is clearly more activated Rac1 present in the Pak1?/? cells compared with the WT cells (Fig. 6 C). The low but detectable levels of GTP-Cdc42 are similar in the Pak1?/? cells versus the WT cells (Fig. 6 C).
6D	Subsequent pull-down assays with the COOH-terminal Rac1 peptide showed that more ?-Pix associ- ates to the Rac1 COOH terminus in the Pak1?/? cells compared with the WT cells (Fig. 6 D). This indicates that in the absence of Pak1, there is more ?-Pix available for Rac1 binding, result- ing in increased Rac1 activation.
6E	We tested this by seeding the WT and Pak1?/? cells on fi bronectin-coated ECIS electrodes. In agreement with the aforementioned hypothesis, we found that the Pak1?/? cells spread more effi ciently than the WT cells (Fig. 6 E).
6F	To confi rm this, we seeded cells on fi bronectin (Fig. 6 F) or collagen (not depicted) and visualized the cells? morphology by phase-contrast microscopy. The Pak1?/? cells did indeed spread more effi ciently, forming clearly detectable lamellipo- dia, whereas most WT cells were round with small membrane extensions (Fig. 6 F).
6G	Furthermore, reconstitution experiments with Pak1 WT or Pak1 P191A and P192A, Pak1 mutants that do not bind ?-Pix (Manser et al., 1998), showed that the enhanced spreading of Pak1?/? cells can be restored with WT Pak1 but not by the Pix-binding mutant (Fig. 6 G). These data suggest that Pak1 controls cell spreading by regulating the ?-Pix?Rac1 interaction and, as a result, ?-Pix?mediated Rac1 activation.
6H	To further confi rm this, we reduced the expression of ?-Pix by means of siRNA in WT and Pak1?/? cells and analyzed their spreading on fi bronectin-coated ECIS electrodes. The enhanced spreading of Pak1?/? cells was reduced when ?-Pix expression is knocked down (Fig. 6 H). Similarly, reducing the expression of ?-Pix in WT cells also impaired their spreading on fi bronec- tin (Fig. 6 H). This indicates that ?-Pix plays a pivotal role in the enhanced spreading of the Pak1?/? and WT cells.
6I	In line with this, we observed that V12Cdc42 induced the trans- location of V12Rac1C189S to the plasma membrane. This confi rms that Cdc42 activation promotes Rac1 membrane tar- geting (Fig. 6 I), which is consistent with the observation that the expression of V12Cdc42 results in the activation of Rac1 (Nobes and Hall, 1995).
