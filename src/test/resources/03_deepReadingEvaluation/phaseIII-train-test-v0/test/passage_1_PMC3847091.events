1	2	1	ASPP1 and ASPP2	activate	p53			Mechanistically ASPP1 and ASPP2 bind RAS-GTP and potentiates RAS signalling to enhance p53 mediated apoptosis [ ].
1	2	2	ASPP1 and ASPP2	bind	GTP			Mechanistically ASPP1 and ASPP2 bind RAS-GTP and potentiates RAS signalling to enhance p53 mediated apoptosis [ ].
1	7	7	<blank>	phosphorylate	ASPP2			We thus tested whether RAS activation may regulate ASPP2 phosphorylation.
1	10	3	p38 SAPK	MedScan_ProtModification	histone 2B			As shown in , histone 2B phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had high levels of incorporated 32P, suggesting that p38 SAPK was active; while under the same conditions, ASPP2 (693-1128) fragment phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had very low levels of incorporated 32P, indicating that p38 SAPK is not an efficient kinase for ASPP2 phosphorylation.
1	10	4	p38 SAPK	MedScan_ProtModification	ASPP2			As shown in , histone 2B phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had high levels of incorporated 32P, suggesting that p38 SAPK was active; while under the same conditions, ASPP2 (693-1128) fragment phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had very low levels of incorporated 32P, indicating that p38 SAPK is not an efficient kinase for ASPP2 phosphorylation.
1	10	8	<blank>	phosphorylate	ASPP2			As shown in , histone 2B phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had high levels of incorporated 32P, suggesting that p38 SAPK was active; while under the same conditions, ASPP2 (693-1128) fragment phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had very low levels of incorporated 32P, indicating that p38 SAPK is not an efficient kinase for ASPP2 phosphorylation.
1	16	5	MAPK2	phosphorylate	ASPP2			(A) ASPP1 and ASPP2 have two conserved putative MAPK2 phosphorylation sites in their C-terminus.
1	16	6	MAPK2	phosphorylate	ASPP2			(A) ASPP1 and ASPP2 have two conserved putative MAPK2 phosphorylation sites in their C-terminus.
