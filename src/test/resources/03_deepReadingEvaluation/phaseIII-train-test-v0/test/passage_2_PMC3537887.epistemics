EPISTEMICS EVALUATION
2.2	1	Here we show that monoubiquitination decreases the sensitivity of Ras to GAP-mediated hydrolysis .
2.6	0.6	Our modeling and NMR analyses indicated that Ubiquitin dynamically samples a broad surface area of Ras that alters switch region dynamics .
2.8	1	The analysis revealed that monoubiquitination abrogates GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis .
