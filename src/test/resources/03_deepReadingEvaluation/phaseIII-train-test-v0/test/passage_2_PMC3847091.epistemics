EPISTEMICS EVALUATION
2.1	1	We and others have recently shown that ASPP2 can potentiate RAS signaling by binding directly via the ASPP2 N-terminus [ , ] .
2.4	1	We show here that ASPP2 is phosphorylated by the RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway and that this phosphorylation leads to its increased translocation to the cytosol/nucleus and increased binding to p53 , providing an explanation of how RAS can activate p53 pro-apoptotic functions .
