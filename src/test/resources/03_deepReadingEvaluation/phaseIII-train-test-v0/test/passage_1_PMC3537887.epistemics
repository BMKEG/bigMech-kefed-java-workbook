EPISTEMICS EVALUATION
1.1	0.8	We next considered the effect of Ras monoubiquitination on GAP-mediated hydrolysis .
1.9	0.6	These results indicate that variations in the linker length on this scale ( 1-2 bonds ) do not influence the sensitivity of monoubiquitinated Ras to GAP downregulation .
1.13	1	These data support our in vitro findings that monoubiquitination increases the population of active , GTP-bound Ras through a defect in sensitivity to GAP-mediated regulation .
