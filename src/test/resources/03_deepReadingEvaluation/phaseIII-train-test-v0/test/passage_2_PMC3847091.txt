We and others have recently shown that ASPP2 can potentiate RAS signaling by binding directly via the ASPP2 N-terminus [ , ].
Moreover, the RAS-apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 interaction enhances the transcription function of p53 in cancer cells [ ].
Until now, it has been unclear how RAS could affect ASPP2 to enhance p53 function.
We show here that ASPP2 is phosphorylated by the RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway and that this phosphorylation leads to its increased translocation to the cytosol/nucleus and increased binding to p53, providing an explanation of how RAS can activate p53 pro-apoptotic functions .
Additionally, RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway activation stabilizes ASPP2 protein, although the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated.
