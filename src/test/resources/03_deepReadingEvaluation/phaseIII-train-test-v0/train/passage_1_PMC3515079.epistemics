EPISTEMICS EVALUATION
1.1	0.5	We hypothesized that the MEK/ERK pathway may suppress trans-phosphorylation of ERBB3 by directly phosphorylating the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 , and that this could be a dominant MEK inhibitor-induced feedback leading to AKT activation in these cancers .
1.4	1	Phospho-specific antibodies confirmed that treatment with AZD6244 inhibited phosphorylation of T669//669 of EGFR and the analogous T677//677 of HER2 ( Figure 5A ) .
1.5	0.6	Together these data indicate that loss of this inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 occurs in cancer cell lines following MEK inhibition .
1.7	0.5	We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity , which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 , thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation .
1.13	1	Together these results support the hypothesis that inhibition of ERK-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved juxtamembrane domain threonine residue leads to feedback activation of EGFR , HER2 , and ERBB3 ( Figure 7 ) .
