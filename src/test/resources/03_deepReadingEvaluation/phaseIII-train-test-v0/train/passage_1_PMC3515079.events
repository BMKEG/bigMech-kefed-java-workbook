1	1	8	<blank>	activate	AKT			We hypothesized that the MEK/ERK pathway may suppress trans-phosphorylation of ERBB3 by directly phosphorylating the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, and that this could be a dominant MEK inhibitor-induced feedback leading to AKT activation in these cancers.
1	5	9	<blank>	phosphorylate	threonine			Together these data indicate that loss of this inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 occurs in cancer cell lines following MEK inhibition.
1	5	10	<blank>	inhibit	MEK			Together these data indicate that loss of this inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2 occurs in cancer cell lines following MEK inhibition.
1	6	11	<blank>	activate	ERBB3			Mutation of T669//669 and T677//677 abrogates MEK inhibitor-induced suppression of ERBB3 activation.
1	7	1	MEK	inhibit	AKT			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	7	3	MEK	inhibit	AKT			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	7	5	MEK	activate	ERBB3			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	7	4	MEK	activate	ERK			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	7	2	MEK	activate	ERK			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	7	12	<blank>	inhibit	MEK			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	7	13	<blank>	phosphorylate	threonine			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	7	14	<blank>	phosphorylate	ERBB3			We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation.
1	9	6	MEK	inhibit	phospho-ERBB3			In cells transfected with wild-type EGFR, MEK inhibition led to feedback activation of phospho-ERBB3 and phosho-EGFR, recapitulating the results we had observed in our panel of cancer cell lines (Figure 6A).
1	9	15	<blank>	activate	phospho-ERBB3			In cells transfected with wild-type EGFR, MEK inhibition led to feedback activation of phospho-ERBB3 and phosho-EGFR, recapitulating the results we had observed in our panel of cancer cell lines (Figure 6A).
1	9	16	<blank>	activate	EGFR			In cells transfected with wild-type EGFR, MEK inhibition led to feedback activation of phospho-ERBB3 and phosho-EGFR, recapitulating the results we had observed in our panel of cancer cell lines (Figure 6A).
1	9	7	phospho-ERBB3	inhibit	MEK			In cells transfected with wild-type EGFR, MEK inhibition led to feedback activation of phospho-ERBB3 and phosho-EGFR, recapitulating the results we had observed in our panel of cancer cell lines (Figure 6A).
1	10	17	<blank>	phosphorylate	EGFR and ERBB3			In contrast, the EGFRT669A mutant increased both basal EGFR and ERBB3 tyrosine phosphorylation that was not augmented by MEK inhibition.
1	10	18	<blank>	inhibit	MEK			In contrast, the EGFRT669A mutant increased both basal EGFR and ERBB3 tyrosine phosphorylation that was not augmented by MEK inhibition.
1	11	19	<blank>	phosphorylate	ERBB3			As a control, we treated CHO-KI cells expressing EGFRT669A with HRG ligand to induce maximal ERBB3 phosphorylation (Figure 6A), indicating that the lack of induction of phospho-ERBB3 in EGFRT669A expressing cells following MEK inhibition was not simply due to the saturation of the system with phospho-ERBB3.
1	11	20	<blank>	induce	phospho-ERBB3			As a control, we treated CHO-KI cells expressing EGFRT669A with HRG ligand to induce maximal ERBB3 phosphorylation (Figure 6A), indicating that the lack of induction of phospho-ERBB3 in EGFRT669A expressing cells following MEK inhibition was not simply due to the saturation of the system with phospho-ERBB3.
1	11	21	<blank>	inhibit	MEK			As a control, we treated CHO-KI cells expressing EGFRT669A with HRG ligand to induce maximal ERBB3 phosphorylation (Figure 6A), indicating that the lack of induction of phospho-ERBB3 in EGFRT669A expressing cells following MEK inhibition was not simply due to the saturation of the system with phospho-ERBB3.
1	13	22	<blank>	activate	EGFR, HER2, and ERBB3			Together these results support the hypothesis that inhibition of ERK-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved juxtamembrane domain threonine residue leads to feedback activation of EGFR, HER2, and ERBB3 (Figure 7).
