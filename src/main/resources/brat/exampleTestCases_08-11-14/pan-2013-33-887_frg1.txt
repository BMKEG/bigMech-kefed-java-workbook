We next asked if HBP1 transcriptionally repressed the DNMT1 promoter through sequence-specific DNA binding. Using Transfac, we found that the DNMT1 promoter contained an HBP1 high-affinity site (TTCATTCATTCATTCTTTCA) at positions bp 115 to 134 from the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2A, top), previously reported as a repression site on the p47phox gene and for position effect variegation (17, 19, 28). Thus, we investigated whether HBP1 bound and repressed the DNMT1 promoter through a putative high-affinity HBP1 element. HBP1 is a member of the sequence-specific HMG box family of transcriptional factors with a central repression domain (amino acids 191 to 400) and a C-terminal HMG box DNA binding domain (amino acids 431 to 509), as well as retinoblastoma and p38 MAPK binding regulatory regions (40, 47, 50). A DNA-binding-defective mutant (pmHMG) was used to investigate sequence-specific repression of the DNMT1 promoter and has a triple-point mutation in the HMG box that abolishes DNA binding. Wild-type HBP1 overexpression decreased DNMT1 protein level, but the DNA-binding-defective mutant (pmHMG) had no effect on DNMT1 protein relative to control cells (Fig. 2C).
