title: List of Experimental Motif Types + Definitions
description:  Here we build a list of experimental motif definitions to serve as the basis of a classification ontology (for consultation and collaboration with OBI curators and other Big Mech participants). .  
layout: defaultTOC

This was initiated from the list on the [10: KEfED Modeling of Coprecipitation Ras Papers](10modelsOfCoprecipitationPapers.html) page. This is where we add definitions and maintain a definitive list + curation manual. 

# Coprecipitation Motifs

* **KOTag\_IP\_WB (knockout+tag - immunoprecipitation - western blot)** 
	* Used to examine the existence of a complex based on knocking a protein out from a cell and then transfecting it back with a tagged group that may be targeted for immunoprecipitation.
	* Example: 11777939_1A
