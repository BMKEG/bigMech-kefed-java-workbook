# MINT + INTACT data

The MINT database provides access to 175 well-curated records of experiments linked
to Figure legends. This is expanded enormously by the INTACT database which contains 1063
papers (note that we only started with INTACT in 2016/03 but we include it here since 
this work completely supercedes that involving MINT).

*Note: we will develop these notes in relation to the discourse and experiment type
analysis work soon.*
