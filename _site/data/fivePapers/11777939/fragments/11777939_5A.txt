In previous studies, we showed that Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 could form a trimeric complex in vivo upon concomitant overexpression of the three proteins. However, we failed to detect the existence of an endogenous S/E/E8 complex (Scita et al., 1999).We reasoned that this could be due to the low efficiency of the immunoprecipitating antibodies used.We thus sought to exploit the availability of eps8 / fibroblasts to circumvent this problem.To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using eps8 / fibroblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored, to physiological levels, with an expression vector encoding a myc epitope-tagged Eps8 ( / [Eps8myc] cells).We selected transfected clones in which the levels of expression of Eps8myc were very similar to those present in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A).Endogenous Sos-1 and E3b1 could be detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted, but not from eps8 / fibroblasts(Fig. 1 B).To determine whether E3b1 mediates the interaction between Eps8 and Sos-1, as it would be expected according to the tricomplex model,we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments under conditions in which the association between Eps8 and E3b1 was disrupted.The binding site of E3b1 to the SH3 domain of Eps8 was previously mapped to the amino acid sequence, PPPPPVDYTEDEE, where the D and the Y residues are critical for efficient binding (Mongiovi et al., 1999).Thus, a peptide encompassing this region should specifically disrupt the Eps8?E3b1 association.Indeed, no E3b1could be recovered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted cells, when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess of the competing peptide.The association was, however, preserved when a control peptide, bearing a Y ? A substitution and unable to bind to Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), was used (Fig. 1 C).Similarly, no Sos-1 could be re-covered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the presence of the competing, but not of the control, peptide (Fig. 1 C).Thus, under physiological conditions, the coimmunoprecipitation of Eps8 and Sos-1 depends on the integrity of the Eps8?E3b1 interaction, pointing to the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.It cannot be formally excluded that Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis, thus allowing coimmunoprecipitation.However, we have previously demonstrated (Scita et al., 2001) that the three endogenous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actinstructures.Thus, the sum of our results strongly argues in favor of the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.Sos-1 has been shown to be part of a signaling complex with Grb2, which mediates the activation of Ras upon RTK stimulation.Our finding that, under physiological conditions, Sos-1 also participates in a complex with Eps8 and E3b1raises the question of the physical and functional relation-ships between these two Sos-1?containing complexes.To gain insight into this issue, we initially mapped the region of E3b1 responsible for the interaction with Sos-1 by using a series of deletion mutants of E3b1 fused to glutathione S -transferase (GST).Native Sos-1 could be efficiently recovered onto GST-E3b1 full length (Fig. 2 A, amino acids [aa] 2?480). Further mapping revealed that the SH3 domain of E3b1 (aa 416?480) was necessary and sufficient for binding (Fig. 2 A).We have previously shown that E3b1 binds to the prolinerich, COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 (aa 1131?1333) (Scita et al., 1999), which also binds to the SH3 of Grb2 (Li et al., 1993 Cussac et al., 1994).Thus, Grb2 and E3b1 might compete for binding to Sos-1.This hypothesis was validated by a series of experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo.We could demonstrate that ( a) the SH3 of Grb2, but not of Eps8, efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro (Fig. 2 B)(b) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR,known to constitute a Grb2-SH3 binding site (Li et al.,1993 Cussac et al., 1994),competed equally well the binding of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 (Fig. 2 C)(c) the binding constants of the interaction between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar (Fig. 2 D)(d) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of GST-E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 (Fig. 3 A) and (e) overexpression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Sos-1 binds either E3b1 or Grb2, in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that two distinct pools of Sos-1 exist in the cells.To test this possibility in vivo, we set out to perturb the equilibrium between the Sos-1?E3b1 (S/E) and Sos-1? Grb2 (S/G) complexes, by increasing the levels of E3b1 within the cell.If the two complexes are functionally distinct, then the overexpression of E3b1, by competing the S/G interaction, should result in (a) reduced Sos-1 recruitment in vivo to active EGFR, (b) consequent reduction in Ras activation, as measured by reduced Ras-GTP levels, (c) reduced activation of Ras-dependent pathways, as measured by activation of MAPK, and finally (d) reduced proliferative response.All of these predictions were confirmed experimentally (Fig. 4, A?C).The competition between E3b1 and Grb2 for the same binding site on Sos-1 implies that an individual Sos-1 molecule can only be part of one GEF complex at a time.However, different pools of Sos-1, either bound to Grb2 or to E3b1, could exist in vivo.We tried to gain insight into this issue.Weshowed that BIAcore measurements revealed similar kinetic parameters for the SH3-mediated S/G and S/E interactions (Fig. 2 D).However, when we measured the relative abundance of S/G and S/E complexes within the cell, we found a 10-fold excess of the former (Fig. 5 A), under conditions in which quantitative immunoprecipitation of the adaptor molecules, Grb2 and E3b1, was achieved (Fig. 5 A).Thus, the data indicate that two pools of Sos-1, associated with different adaptors, exist simultaneously in the cell.They further suggest that the pool of E3b1, available for binding to Sos-1, is reduced relative to that of Grb2, and may be rate-limiting.
