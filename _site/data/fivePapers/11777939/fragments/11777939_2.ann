T0	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 0 246	In previous studies, we showed that Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 could form a trimeric complex in vivo upon concomitant overexpression of the three proteins. However, we failed to detect the existence of an endogenous S/E/E8 complex (Scita et al., 1999).
T1	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 247 346	We reasoned that this could be due to the low efficiency of the immunoprecipitating antibodies used.
T2	v1_bD_sA 347 438	We thus sought to exploit the availability of eps8 / fibroblasts to circumvent this problem.
T3	method 439 674	To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using eps8 / fibroblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored, to physiological levels, with an expression vector encoding a myc epitope-tagged Eps8 ( / [Eps8myc] cells).
T4	result_v3_bD_sA 675 821	We selected transfected clones in which the levels of expression of Eps8myc were very similar to those present in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A).
T5	result_v3_bD_sA 822 966	Endogenous Sos-1 and E3b1 could be detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted, but not from eps8 / fibroblasts
T6	result_v3_bD_sA 967 977	(Fig. 1 B).
T7	v1_bD_sA 978 1110	To determine whether E3b1 mediates the interaction between Eps8 and Sos-1, as it would be expected according to the tricomplex model,
T8	method 1111 1235	we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments under conditions in which the association between Eps8 and E3b1 was disrupted.
T9	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 1236 1441	The binding site of E3b1 to the SH3 domain of Eps8 was previously mapped to the amino acid sequence, PPPPPVDYTEDEE, where the D and the Y residues are critical for efficient binding (Mongiovi et al., 1999).
T10	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 1442 1536	Thus, a peptide encompassing this region should specifically disrupt the Eps8?E3b1 association.
T11	result_v3_bD_sA 1537 1743	Indeed, no E3b1could be recovered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted cells, when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess of the competing peptide.
T12	result_v3_bD_sA 1744 1908	The association was, however, preserved when a control peptide, bearing a Y ? A substitution and unable to bind to Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), was used (Fig. 1 C).
T13	result_v3_bD_sA 1909 1940	Similarly, no Sos-1 could be re-
T14	result_v3_bD_sA 1941 2056	covered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the presence of the competing, but not of the control, peptide (Fig. 1 C).
T15	implication_v2_bD_sA 2057 2253	Thus, under physiological conditions, the coimmunoprecipitation of Eps8 and Sos-1 depends on the integrity of the Eps8?E3b1 interaction, pointing to the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.
T16	implication_v2_bD_sA 2254 2375	It cannot be formally excluded that Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis, thus allowing coimmunoprecipitation.
T17	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 2376 2512	However, we have previously demonstrated (Scita et al., 2001) that the three endogenous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actin
T18	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 2513 2523	structures.
T19	implication_v2_bD_sA 2524 2628	Thus, the sum of our results strongly argues in favor of the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.
T20	result_v3_bD_sA 2629 2752	Sos-1 has been shown to be part of a signaling complex with Grb2, which mediates the activation of Ras upon RTK stimulation.
T21	result_v3_bD_sA 2753 2857	Our finding that, under physiological conditions, Sos-1 also participates in a complex with Eps8 and E3b1
T22	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 2858 2917	raises the question of the physical and functional relation-
T23	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 2918 2968	ships between these two Sos-1?containing complexes.
