T0	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 0 246	In previous studies, we showed that Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 could form a trimeric complex in vivo upon concomitant overexpression of the three proteins. However, we failed to detect the existence of an endogenous S/E/E8 complex (Scita et al., 1999).
T1	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 247 346	We reasoned that this could be due to the low efficiency of the immunoprecipitating antibodies used.
T2	v1_bD_sA 347 438	We thus sought to exploit the availability of eps8 / fibroblasts to circumvent this problem.
T3	method 439 674	To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using eps8 / fibroblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored, to physiological levels, with an expression vector encoding a myc epitope-tagged Eps8 ( / [Eps8myc] cells).
T4	result_v3_bD_sA 675 821	We selected transfected clones in which the levels of expression of Eps8myc were very similar to those present in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A).
T5	result_v3_bD_sA 822 966	Endogenous Sos-1 and E3b1 could be detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted, but not from eps8 / fibroblasts
T6	result_v3_bD_sA 967 977	(Fig. 1 B).
T7	v1_bD_sA 978 1110	To determine whether E3b1 mediates the interaction between Eps8 and Sos-1, as it would be expected according to the tricomplex model,
T8	method 1111 1235	we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments under conditions in which the association between Eps8 and E3b1 was disrupted.
T9	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 1236 1441	The binding site of E3b1 to the SH3 domain of Eps8 was previously mapped to the amino acid sequence, PPPPPVDYTEDEE, where the D and the Y residues are critical for efficient binding (Mongiovi et al., 1999).
T10	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 1442 1536	Thus, a peptide encompassing this region should specifically disrupt the Eps8?E3b1 association.
T11	result_v3_bD_sA 1537 1743	Indeed, no E3b1could be recovered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted cells, when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess of the competing peptide.
T12	result_v3_bD_sA 1744 1908	The association was, however, preserved when a control peptide, bearing a Y ? A substitution and unable to bind to Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), was used (Fig. 1 C).
T13	result_v3_bD_sA 1909 1940	Similarly, no Sos-1 could be re-
T14	result_v3_bD_sA 1941 2056	covered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the presence of the competing, but not of the control, peptide (Fig. 1 C).
T15	implication_v2_bD_sA 2057 2253	Thus, under physiological conditions, the coimmunoprecipitation of Eps8 and Sos-1 depends on the integrity of the Eps8?E3b1 interaction, pointing to the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.
T16	implication_v2_bD_sA 2254 2375	It cannot be formally excluded that Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis, thus allowing coimmunoprecipitation.
T17	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 2376 2512	However, we have previously demonstrated (Scita et al., 2001) that the three endogenous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actin
T18	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 2513 2523	structures.
T19	implication_v2_bD_sA 2524 2628	Thus, the sum of our results strongly argues in favor of the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.
T20	result_v3_bD_sA 2629 2752	Sos-1 has been shown to be part of a signaling complex with Grb2, which mediates the activation of Ras upon RTK stimulation.
T21	result_v3_bD_sA 2753 2857	Our finding that, under physiological conditions, Sos-1 also participates in a complex with Eps8 and E3b1
T22	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 2858 2917	raises the question of the physical and functional relation-
T23	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 2918 2968	ships between these two Sos-1?containing complexes.
T24	v1_bD_sA 2969 3001	To gain insight into this issue, 
T25	method 3002 3171	we initially mapped the region of E3b1 responsible for the interaction with Sos-1 by using a series of deletion mutants of E3b1 fused to glutathione S -transferase (GST).
T26	result_v3_bD_sA 3172 3395	Native Sos-1 could be efficiently recovered onto GST-E3b1 full length (Fig. 2 A, amino acids [aa] 2?480). Further mapping revealed that the SH3 domain of E3b1 (aa 416?480) was necessary and sufficient for binding (Fig. 2 A).
T27	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 3396 3595	We have previously shown that E3b1 binds to the prolinerich, COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 (aa 1131?1333) (Scita et al., 1999), which also binds to the SH3 of Grb2 (Li et al., 1993 Cussac et al., 1994).
T28	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 3596 3650	Thus, Grb2 and E3b1 might compete for binding to Sos-1.
T29	method 3651 3743	This hypothesis was validated by a series of experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo.
T30	result_v3_bD_sA 3744 3929	We could demonstrate that ( a) the SH3 of Grb2, but not of Eps8, efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro (Fig. 2 B)
T31	result_v3_bD_sA 3930 3964	(b) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR,
T32	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 3965 4019	known to constitute a Grb2-SH3 binding site (Li et al.,
T33	cited-result_v3_bD_sN 4020 4045	1993 Cussac et al., 1994),
T34	result_v3_bD_sA 4046 4152	competed equally well the binding of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 (Fig. 2 C)
T35	result_v3_bD_sA 4153 4315	(c) the binding constants of the interaction between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar (Fig. 2 D)
T36	result_v3_bD_sA 4316 4662	(d) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of GST-E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 (Fig. 3 A) and (e) overexpression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Sos-1 binds either E3b1 or Grb2, in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that two distinct pools of Sos-1 exist in the cells.
T37	v1_bD_sA 4663 4696	To test this possibility in vivo, 
T38	method 4697 4845	we set out to perturb the equilibrium between the Sos-1?E3b1 (S/E) and Sos-1? Grb2 (S/G) complexes, by increasing the levels of E3b1 within the cell.
T39	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 4846 5246	If the two complexes are functionally distinct, then the overexpression of E3b1, by competing the S/G interaction, should result in (a) reduced Sos-1 recruitment in vivo to active EGFR, (b) consequent reduction in Ras activation, as measured by reduced Ras-GTP levels, (c) reduced activation of Ras-dependent pathways, as measured by activation of MAPK, and finally (d) reduced proliferative response.
T40	result_v3_bD_sA 5247 5315	All of these predictions were confirmed experimentally (Fig. 4, A?C).
T41	v2_bR_sA 5316 5476	The competition between E3b1 and Grb2 for the same binding site on Sos-1 implies that an individual Sos-1 molecule can only be part of one GEF complex at a time.
T42	hypothesis_v1_b0_sA 5477 5564	However, different pools of Sos-1, either bound to Grb2 or to E3b1, could exist in vivo.
T43	method 5565 5605	We tried to gain insight into this issue.
T44	result_v3_bD_sA 247 248	We
T45	result_v3_bD_sA 5608 5733	showed that BIAcore measurements revealed similar kinetic parameters for the SH3-mediated S/G and S/E interactions (Fig. 2 D).
