(C) Ramos cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with IL-4 (100 U/ml). Nuclear extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with either an anti–IRF-4 or an anti–BCL-6 antiserum. The immune complexes were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by Western blotting using an anti–BCL-6 antiserum (top). The blot was later stripped and reprobed with an anti–IRF-4 antiserum (bottom), as described in the legend to Fig. 3 .
