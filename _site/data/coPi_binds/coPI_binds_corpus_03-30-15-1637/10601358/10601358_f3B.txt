(B) Ramos cells were stimulated as described in the legend to Fig. 2 . JY cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with IL-4 (100 U/ml). WCEs were then prepared and immunoprecipitated with an IRF-4 antiserum. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting using a Stat6 Ab (top). The blot was later stripped and reprobed with an anti–IRF-4 antiserum (bottom) using protein A–horseradish peroxidase conjugate as a secondary detection reagent to probe the primary Ab binding.
