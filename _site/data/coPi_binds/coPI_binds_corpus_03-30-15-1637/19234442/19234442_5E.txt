Significantly, we found that Fe65 protein interacted with endogenous JNK1 by co-immunoprecipitation in 293T cells treated with the DNA-damage agent etoposide ( Fig. 5e ), consistent with the idea that Fe65 helps to mediate JNK1 recruitment to Î³H2AX. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the second PTB domain on Fe65 may be key for the interaction between Fe65 and tyrosine phosphorylated H2AX ( Supplementary Fig. 12a ).
