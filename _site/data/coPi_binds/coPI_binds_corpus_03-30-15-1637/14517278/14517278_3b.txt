We were interested in determining if TRAM might also associate with IRF-3. When HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged TRAM and immunoprecipitated with antibody to endogenous IRF-3, Flag-tagged TRAM could be detected in the immunoprecipitated complex ( Fig. 3 b, top). Immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody confirmed this interaction; endogenous and cotransfected IRF-3 could be detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes ( Fig. 3 b, second panel). TRIF also interacted with endogenous and transfected IRF-3 in agreement with published studies (unpublished data). There were no nonspecific associations detected in cells lacking the transfected adaptor constructs. Although not shown, we also performed similar experiments with IRF-7. IRF-7 also interacted with TRAM and TRIF and vice versa.
