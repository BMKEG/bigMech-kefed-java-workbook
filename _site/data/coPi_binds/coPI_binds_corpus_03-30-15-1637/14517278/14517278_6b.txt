These immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that TRAM interacted with both TRIF and Mal/TIRAP ( Fig. 6 b, left). TRIF also interacted with Mal ( Fig. 6 b, right). Finally, both TRIF and TRAM interacted with the Mal-P125H (dominant negative) mutant. The stronger interaction of TRIF and TRAM observed with the Mal-P125H mutant does not reflect a higher avidity for this interaction but rather was a consequence of the higher expression level of the MAL-P125H mutant in whole cell lysates, compared with the expression level of Mal or TRIF ( Fig. 6 b, middle).
