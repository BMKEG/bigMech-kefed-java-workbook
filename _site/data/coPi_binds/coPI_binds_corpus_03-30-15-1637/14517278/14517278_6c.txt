Coimmunoprecipitation studies were next performed to determine if TRAM interacts with TLR4. Stable TLR3- or TLR4-expressing cell lines were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged expression vectors for TRAM, TRAM-C113H, and Mal, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. These experiments indicated that TRAM interacts with TLR4 but not with TLR3 ( Fig. 6 c), one more indication of the specificity of TRAM for the TLR4 pathway. The dominant negative mutant TRAM-C113H failed to immunoprecipitate with TLR4, suggesting that the C113 residue is critical for this interaction. Mal also interacted with TLR4 and not TLR3, providing additional evidence that Mal has a role in the TLR4 but not the TLR3 signaling pathway.
