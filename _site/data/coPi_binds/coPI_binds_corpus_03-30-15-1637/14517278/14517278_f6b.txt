(b) 293T cells were transfected with 4 Î¼g of TRAM-CFP or TRIF-CFP and cotransfected with Flag-Mal, Flag-Mal-P125H, or Flag-TRIF. Whole cell lysates were harvested 48 h later and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (which also immunoprecipitates cyan fluorescent protein [CFP] or yellow fluorescent protein [YFP]). Immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for Flag-tagged adapters. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were also analyzed for CFP- and Flag-tagged proteins by immunoblotting.
