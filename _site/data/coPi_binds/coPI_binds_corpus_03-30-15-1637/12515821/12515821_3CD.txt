To rule out the possibility that GEFs other than Sos-1 might be contained in the Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complex and be responsible for the observed Rac-GEF activity, we engineered a dominant-negative form of Sos-1, carrying point mutations inactivating the DH domain ( Soisson et al., 1998 ; Mettouchi et al., 2001 ). Cells were transfected with a combination of mycEps8, Abi1, and either wild-type Sos-1 or Sos-1DH−. Sos-1DH− associates with the Eps8–Abi1 complex as efficiently as wild-type Sos-1 ( Fig. 3 C). However, no Rac-GEF activity could be detected in Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1DH− immunocomplexes as compared with the Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complex under conditions in which equal amounts of wild-type or mutant Sos-1 were present ( Fig. 3, C and D ). Moreover, the addition of water-soluble PIP3 increased the Rac-GEF of the Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1, but not of the Eps8–Abi–SosDH− immunocomplex ( Fig. 3 D). Thus, Sos-1 is not only critical for Rac-GEF activity of the Eps8–Abi1–p85–Sos-1 complex, but it is also required to confer responsiveness to PIP3. The above observations indicate that the recruitment of PI3K by Abi1 into an Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complex is necessary and sufficient to activate, in vitro, the Rac-GEF capability of the latter. They further highlight a regulatory role exerted by PIP3 on this complex. If these in vitro findings were to translate into physiologically relevant events, then one would predict that (1) interference with the formation of the Eps8–Abi1–p85–Sos-1 complex either by preventing the binding between Abi1 and p85 ( Fig. 3 A) or by genetically removing p85; and (2) pharmacological inhibition of PI3-K by wortmannin should affect Rac activation mediated by the complex in vivo.
