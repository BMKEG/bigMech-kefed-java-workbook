Indeed, as previously reported, tyrosine phosphorylation of Abi1 was readily detectable ( Juang and Hoffmann, 1999 ; Fan and Goff, 2000 ) and was abolished by treatment with alkaline phosphatase ( Fig. 1 C, left panels and supplemental materials). Finally, a Far-western analysis revealed that the NH 2 -terminal SH2 of p85 bound directly and specifically to Abi1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner ( Fig. 1 C).
