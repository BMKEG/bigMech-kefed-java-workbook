This, and the results presented here, raise the possibility that the recruitment in vivo of PI3K to the complex is also required. Cells were transfected with a combination of Sos-1–mycEps8–Abi1wt or Sos-1–mycEps8–Abi1Y407F, and Rac-GEF assays were performed on anti-myc immunoprecipitates. Trimeric Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complexes were readily detected that contained similar amounts of the catalytic subunit Sos-1 ( Fig. 3 A).
