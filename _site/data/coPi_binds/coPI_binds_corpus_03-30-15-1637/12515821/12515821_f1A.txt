(A) Left; lysates (5 mg) from MEFs were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies (ctr, preimmune serum). Abi1 could also be detected in p85 immunoprecipitates (supplemental materials). About 1% of total p85 could be found associated with Abi1 immunoprecipitates. Right; lysates (5 mg; p85 = 0.3 mg) from MEFs were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies (top). The immunocomplexes were tested for PI3K lipid kinase activity by TLC (bottom; Domin et al., 1996 ).
