The isolated mutations of the Ser/Thr residues within the second (amino acids 299/301) or the sixth (amino acids 453/455) SDT cluster had only marginal effects, and these mutants bound NBS1 almost as efficiently as the WT MDC1 N terminus ( Fig. 7 A , lanes 1–3). Strikingly, a combination of these mutations (designated as 4A) markedly impaired the ability to bind NBS1 ( Fig. 7 A , lane 4), and mutation of the Ser/Thr residues in all six SDT clusters (12A) abolished the MDC1–NBS1 interaction completely ( Fig. 7 A , lane 5).
