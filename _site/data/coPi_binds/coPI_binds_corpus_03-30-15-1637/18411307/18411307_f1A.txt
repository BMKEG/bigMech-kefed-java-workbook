(A) Endogenous MDC1 and NBS1 interact both before and after DNA damage. Lysates from U2OS cells either mock or Î³ irradiated (10 Gy for 1 h) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-MDC1 antibody and analyzed for the presence of NBS1 by immunoblotting. A nonimmune species-matched antibody was used as a control. Expression levels of NBS1 in whole cell extracts (bottom) indicate an equal input in each lane.
