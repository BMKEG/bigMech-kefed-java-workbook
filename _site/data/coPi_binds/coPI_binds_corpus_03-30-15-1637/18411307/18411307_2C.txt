The fragment containing all six SDT repeats efficiently bound to endogenous NBS1 when expressed in the U2OS/shRNA cell line ( Fig. 2 C , lane 4). Strikingly, even shorter fragments containing either three N-terminal (SDT1) or four C-terminal (SDT2) repeats still interacted with NBS1, albeit with a lower efficiency than the full-length SDT region ( Fig. 2 C , lanes 5 and 6). Conversely, deletion of the entire SDT region completely abolished the ability of the MDC1 N terminus to bind NBS1 under these conditions ( Fig. 2 C , lane 3).
