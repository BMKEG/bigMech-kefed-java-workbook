(C) −/− [Eps8myc] cells were treated with 20 ng/ml of PDGF (+) or mock treated (−), and total cellular lysates were prepared. Immmunoprecipitations (IP) were performed with anti-myc antibody or with an irrelevant (ctr) antibody, followed by immunoblot with the antibody indicated on the right (WB). The indicated lanes (lysates) were loaded with 100 μg of total cellular lysates.
