We have previously shown that E3b1 binds to the proline-rich, COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 (aa 1131â€“1333) ( Scita et al., 1999 ), which also binds to the SH3 of Grb2 ( Li et al., 1993 ; Cussac et al., 1994 ). Thus, Grb2 and E3b1 might compete for binding to Sos-1. This hypothesis was validated by a series of experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo. We could demonstrate that ( a) the SH3 of Grb2, but not of Eps8, efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro ( Fig. 2 B); (b) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR, known to constitute a Grb2-SH3 binding site ( Li et al., 1993 ; Cussac et al., 1994 ), competed equally well the binding of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 ( Fig. 2 C); (c) the binding constants of the interaction between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar ( Fig. 2 D); (d) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of GST-E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 ( Fig. 3 A); and (e) overexpression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 ( Fig. 3 B). Thus, Sos-1 binds either E3b1 or Grb2, in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that two distinct pools of Sos-1 exist in the cells.
