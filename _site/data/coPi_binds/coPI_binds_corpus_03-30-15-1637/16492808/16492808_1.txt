Recently, we showed that cell-permeable versions of the COOH termini of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 act as selective inhibitors of the respective GTPases in a variety of cell types, presumably by interfering with the proper targeting of these GTPases ( van Hennik et al., 2003 ). We noticed that the COOH terminus of Rac1, which binds the SH3 domain of Crk ( van Hennik et al., 2003 ), shows homology to a SH3 domain–binding motif in Pak1 and SPIN90. Interestingly, both Pak1 and SPIN90 interact with the SH3 domain of Rac1/Cdc42 GEF β-Pix ( Manser et al., 1998 ; Lim et al., 2003 ), suggesting that Rac1 might also interact with β-Pix.
