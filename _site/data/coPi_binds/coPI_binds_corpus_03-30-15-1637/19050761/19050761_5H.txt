Hence to further establish as to whether c-Src interacts with IQGAP1 we tested the ability of SH2 and SH3 domains of c-Src to associate with IQGAP1 in an in vitro pull-down assay. The result showed that SH2 domain of c-Src interacts with IQGAP1 independent of its tyrosine phosphorylation since SH2 domain of c-Src forms a complex with IQGAP1 prior to stimulation of cells with ligand ( Figure 5H ). Additional analysis using PAE cells null for chimeric VEGFR-2 revealed that indeed association of SH2 domain of Src with IQGAP1 is independent of VEGFR-2 (data not shown).
