Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) with immunoblotting analysis shows, EGFR immunecomplex from Panc-1 or Colo-357 whole-cell lysates contained both Src and Stat3 ( Fig. 1A(i) ), Src immunecomplex contained both EGFR and Stat3 ( Fig. 1A(ii) ), while Stat3 immunoprecipitate contained EGFR and Src ( Fig. 1A(iii) ). For specificity, the non-specific rabbit IgG in the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis for Src, Stat3 or EGFR showed no detectable protein ( Fig. 1A , IgG, and data not shown), and the immunoblotting analysis performed on the immune precipitates in the presence of the respective blocking peptides (BP) showed a complete or near complete block of the immune detection of Stat3, Src or EGFR, compared to the levels detected in the absence of the blocking peptides ( Fig. 1B(i)-(iii) , compare + BP, lower panels to - BP, upper panels).
