Co-immunoprecipitation with immunoblotting analysis of nuclear extracts shows that EGFR immunecomplex contained both Stat3 and Src ( Fig. 2A (i), IP:EGFR), Src immunecomplex contained both Stat3 and EGFR ( Fig. 2A(ii) , IP:Src), while Stat3 immunecomplex contained both EGFR and Src ( Fig. 2A(iii) , IP:Stat3). These data demonstrated the presence of the EGFR, Src and Stat3 heteromeric complex in the nucleus. For specificity of the immunoreagents, the non-specific rabbit IgG pull-down samples that were similarly immunoblotted showed no detectable EGFR, Src or Stat3 ( Fig. 2A , IgG and data not shown). Immunoblotting analysis probing for the Tata-binding protein (TBP) confirmed that the extracts used in these studies are of nuclear origin ( Fig. 2A(iv) ).
