The results of these studies showed the presence of EGFR and Stat3 in the sequential immunoprecipitates ( Fig. 2B , IP:EGFR/IP:Src). By contrast, IgG pull-down that was subjected to immunoblotting for EGFR or Stat3 showed no detectable levels ( Fig. 2B , IgG), further confirming the specificity of the immunoreagents used.
