To test if Gab1 is sufficient to mediate c-Met–specific signals, we substituted the cytoplasmic tail of the trk-met construct with Gab1 sequences. When stimulated with NGF, the trk-met-Gab1 hybrid receptor, but not trk-met lacking the cytoplasmic tail, associates with CRKL, Shp2 and PI(3)K ( Fig. 5 A). Trk-met-Gab1Cter expressing trk-met plus only the COOH-terminal coding sequences of Gab1, residues 450–695, does not bind CRKL, but can still associate with Shp2 and PI(3)K. The associations of Shp2 and PI(3)K depend on Y628 or Y473 and Y590 which are mutated in trk-met-CterΔShp2 and trk-met-CterΔPI(3)K, respectively ( Fig. 5 A). This suggests that Gab1 expressed in this hybrid form is efficiently phosphorylated and associates with signaling molecules similar to Gab1 proteins stimulated by activated c-Met.
