(B) Gab1 proteins and p85 PI(3)K were expressed in 293 cells and following stimulation with HGF/SF, examined for interactions with downstream interaction partners. The Gab1 mutants are the same as in Fig. 4 A, except that the ΔCBR, ΔPI(3)K, and ΔShp2 mutations were introduced into full-size Gab1 cDNA. Gab1 proteins were precipitated with anti-Flag beads and immune complexes detected by Western blotting.
