Similar results were obtained when interactions were analyzed in mammalian expression systems: Gab1 mutant proteins were transiently expressed in 293 cells and precipitated after stimulation with HGF/SF. Western blots were probed sequentially with antibodies against CRKL, p85, Shp2, and Gab1 ( Fig. 4 B). The PH domain of Gab1 has been shown to be able to bind phospholipids and is important for membrane targeting ( Isakoff et al. 1998 ; Maroun et al. 1999 ). However, deletion of the PH domain (ΔPH) did not reduce the HGF/SF-induced association with Shp2, CRKL, or PI(3)K ( Fig. 4 B). CRKL binding was abrogated in the Gab1 mutants expressing only the COOH terminus of Gab1 (Gab1Cter) and strongly reduced in the mutant lacking the CRKL-binding region (ΔCBR), while Shp2 can also associate with the COOH terminus of Gab1, but requires Y628 which is mutated in Gab1ΔShp2. As we had observed by yeast two-hybrid analysis, the Gab1 mutant ΔPI(3)K which carries mutations in all three PI(3)K consensus binding sites, can still associate with the p85 subunit of PI(3)K, even though less strongly than wild-type Gab1 ( Fig. 4 B). PI(3)K associates also efficiently with Gab1Cter lacking amino acids 1–449, but this interaction is strongly reduced by mutation of the remaining PI(3)K consensus binding sites, Y473 and Y590 (CterΔPI(3)K) ( Fig. 4 B).
