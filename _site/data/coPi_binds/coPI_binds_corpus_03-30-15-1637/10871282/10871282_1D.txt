To assess the contribution of Grb2 for Gab1-c-Met association in cells, we carried out immunoprecipitation analyses using the newly identified mutants: 293 human kidney epithelial cells were transfected with plasmid vectors expressing Flag epitope-tagged Gab1 proteins and HA epitope-tagged Grb2. After stimulation of endogenous c-Met with HGF/SF, Gab1 and its mutant proteins were precipitated with anti-Flag antibodies and immune complexes analyzed by Western blotting ( Fig. 1 D). Interaction of Gab1 with c-Met is abrogated by the MBS mutation (Δc-Met), while the Gab1 mutant which lacks both Grb2 association sites (ΔGrb2) can still bind c-Met, even though at a reduced strength compared with wild-type Gab1. Grb2 association with Gab1 was not affected by the V490A mutation in the MBS (Δc-Met), but impaired by mutation of the two Grb2-binding sites (ΔGrb2). These results demonstrate that in cells association of Gab1 with c-Met depends on direct interaction via its MBS, while Grb2 binding may add to the strength of the interaction.
