(D) Association of Gab1 mutants with c-Met and Grb2 in tissue culture. 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged Grb2 expression vector plus pBat-Flag (Control) or expression vectors encoding Flag-tagged Gab1 proteins as indicated. After stimulation with HGF/SF, proteins were precipitated with anti-Flag agarose. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies as indicated.
