(A) Association of trk-met-Gab1 fusion proteins with signaling proteins in 293 cells. After stimulation with NGF, trk-met-Gab1 proteins were precipitated using myc epitope-tag. Coprecipitating proteins were detected by immuno-blotting. Trk-met-control encodes trk-met lacking the multiple docking site of Met. Gab1 proteins were fused COOH-terminally of trk-met. Gab1Cter encodes residues 450–695 of wild-type Gab1, and CterΔPI(3)K and CterΔShp2 express the COOH-terminal coding sequences of the Gab1 mutants ΔPI(3)K and ΔShp2 (as in Fig. 4 A).
