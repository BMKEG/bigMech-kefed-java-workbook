In previous studies, we showed that Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 could form a trimeric complex in vivo upon concomitant overexpression of the three proteins. However, we failed to detect the existence of an endogenous S/E/E8 complex (Scita et al., 1999).We reasoned that this could be due to the low efficiency of the immunoprecipitating antibodies used.We thus sought to exploit the availability of eps8 / fibroblasts to circumvent this problem.To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using eps8 / fibroblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored, to physiological levels, with an expression vector encoding a myc epitope-tagged Eps8 ( / [Eps8myc] cells).We selected transfected clones in which the levels of expression of Eps8myc were very similar to those present in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A).Endogenous Sos-1 and E3b1 could be detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted, but not from eps8 / fibroblasts(Fig. 1 B).To determine whether E3b1 mediates the interaction between Eps8 and Sos-1, as it would be expected according to the tricomplex model,we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments under conditions in which the association between Eps8 and E3b1 was disrupted.The binding site of E3b1 to the SH3 domain of Eps8 was previously mapped to the amino acid sequence, PPPPPVDYTEDEE, where the D and the Y residues are critical for efficient binding (Mongiovi et al., 1999).Thus, a peptide encompassing this region should specifically disrupt the Eps8?E3b1 association.Indeed, no E3b1could be recovered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted cells, when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess of the competing peptide.The association was, however, preserved when a control peptide, bearing a Y ? A substitution and unable to bind to Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), was used (Fig. 1 C).Similarly, no Sos-1 could be re-covered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the presence of the competing, but not of the control, peptide (Fig. 1 C).Thus, under physiological conditions, the coimmunoprecipitation of Eps8 and Sos-1 depends on the integrity of the Eps8?E3b1 interaction, pointing to the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.It cannot be formally excluded that Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis, thus allowing coimmunoprecipitation.However, we have previously demonstrated (Scita et al., 2001) that the three endogenous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actinstructures.Thus, the sum of our results strongly argues in favor of the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.Sos-1 has been shown to be part of a signaling complex with Grb2, which mediates the activation of Ras upon RTK stimulation.Our finding that, under physiological conditions, Sos-1 also participates in a complex with Eps8 and E3b1raises the question of the physical and functional relation-ships between these two Sos-1?containing complexes.
