In previous studies, we showed that Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 could form a trimeric complex in vivo upon concomitant overexpression of the three proteins. However, we failed to detect the existence of an endogenous S/E/E8 complex (Scita et al., 1999).We reasoned that this could be due to the low efficiency of the immunoprecipitating antibodies used.We thus sought to exploit the availability of eps8 / fibroblasts to circumvent this problem.To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using eps8 / fibroblasts in which the expression of Eps8 was restored, to physiological levels, with an expression vector encoding a myc epitope-tagged Eps8 ( / [Eps8myc] cells).We selected transfected clones in which the levels of expression of Eps8myc were very similar to those present in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A).Endogenous Sos-1 and E3b1 could be detected in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted, but not from eps8 / fibroblasts(Fig. 1 B).To determine whether E3b1 mediates the interaction between Eps8 and Sos-1, as it would be expected according to the tricomplex model,we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments under conditions in which the association between Eps8 and E3b1 was disrupted.The binding site of E3b1 to the SH3 domain of Eps8 was previously mapped to the amino acid sequence, PPPPPVDYTEDEE, where the D and the Y residues are critical for efficient binding (Mongiovi et al., 1999).Thus, a peptide encompassing this region should specifically disrupt the Eps8?E3b1 association.Indeed, no E3b1could be recovered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of Eps8myc-reconstituted cells, when the immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess of the competing peptide.The association was, however, preserved when a control peptide, bearing a Y ? A substitution and unable to bind to Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), was used (Fig. 1 C).Similarly, no Sos-1 could be re-covered in anti-myc immunoprecipitates in the presence of the competing, but not of the control, peptide (Fig. 1 C).Thus, under physiological conditions, the coimmunoprecipitation of Eps8 and Sos-1 depends on the integrity of the Eps8?E3b1 interaction, pointing to the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.It cannot be formally excluded that Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis, thus allowing coimmunoprecipitation.However, we have previously demonstrated (Scita et al., 2001) that the three endogenous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actinstructures.Thus, the sum of our results strongly argues in favor of the existence of a physiological S/E/E8 complex.Sos-1 has been shown to be part of a signaling complex with Grb2, which mediates the activation of Ras upon RTK stimulation.Our finding that, under physiological conditions, Sos-1 also participates in a complex with Eps8 and E3b1raises the question of the physical and functional relation-ships between these two Sos-1?containing complexes.To gain insight into this issue, we initially mapped the region of E3b1 responsible for the interaction with Sos-1 by using a series of deletion mutants of E3b1 fused to glutathione S -transferase (GST).Native Sos-1 could be efficiently recovered onto GST-E3b1 full length (Fig. 2 A, amino acids [aa] 2?480). Further mapping revealed that the SH3 domain of E3b1 (aa 416?480) was necessary and sufficient for binding (Fig. 2 A).We have previously shown that E3b1 binds to the prolinerich, COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 (aa 1131?1333) (Scita et al., 1999), which also binds to the SH3 of Grb2 (Li et al., 1993 Cussac et al., 1994).Thus, Grb2 and E3b1 might compete for binding to Sos-1.This hypothesis was validated by a series of experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo.We could demonstrate that ( a) the SH3 of Grb2, but not of Eps8, efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro (Fig. 2 B)(b) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR,known to constitute a Grb2-SH3 binding site (Li et al.,1993 Cussac et al., 1994),competed equally well the binding of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 (Fig. 2 C)(c) the binding constants of the interaction between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar (Fig. 2 D)(d) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of GST-E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 (Fig. 3 A) and (e) overexpression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Sos-1 binds either E3b1 or Grb2, in a mutually exclusive fashion, suggesting that two distinct pools of Sos-1 exist in the cells.To test this possibility in vivo, we set out to perturb the equilibrium between the Sos-1?E3b1 (S/E) and Sos-1? Grb2 (S/G) complexes, by increasing the levels of E3b1 within the cell.If the two complexes are functionally distinct, then the overexpression of E3b1, by competing the S/G interaction, should result in (a) reduced Sos-1 recruitment in vivo to active EGFR, (b) consequent reduction in Ras activation, as measured by reduced Ras-GTP levels, (c) reduced activation of Ras-dependent pathways, as measured by activation of MAPK, and finally (d) reduced proliferative response.All of these predictions were confirmed experimentally (Fig. 4, A?C).The competition between E3b1 and Grb2 for the same binding site on Sos-1 implies that an individual Sos-1 molecule can only be part of one GEF complex at a time.However, different pools of Sos-1, either bound to Grb2 or to E3b1, could exist in vivo.We tried to gain insight into this issue.Weshowed that BIAcore measurements revealed similar kinetic parameters for the SH3-mediated S/G and S/E interactions (Fig. 2 D).However, when we measured the relative abundance of S/G and S/E complexes within the cell, we found a 10-fold excess of the former (Fig. 5 A), under conditions in which quantitative immunoprecipitation of the adaptor molecules, Grb2 and E3b1, was achieved (Fig. 5 A).Thus, the data indicate that two pools of Sos-1, associated with different adaptors, exist simultaneously in the cell.They further suggest that the pool of E3b1, available for binding to Sos-1, is reduced relative to that of Grb2, and may be rate-limiting.Indeed, overexpression of E3b1 resulted in increased PAK65 activity, an indicator of Rac activation (Manser et al., 1994) (Fig. 5 B), which was abrogated by a dominant negative Rac mutant (Fig. 5 B).On the other hand, overexpression of Sos-1did not lead to increased PAK65 activity.An additional corollary of this hypothesis is that the overexpression of E3b1, by facilitating the formation of a trimeric complex with Eps8 and Sos-1, should directly lead to activation of Rac.To test this predictionE3b1 or a mutant of E3b1 (E3b1-DY), bearing alanine substitutions of the DY residues critical for the interaction with Eps8 (Mongiovi et al., 1999), were used to infect wild-type and eps8 / fibroblasts.The levels of GTP-bound Rac were then determined by in vitro binding assays using the immobilized CRIB domain of PAK65 (Manser et al., 1994).E3b1, but not the E3b1 mutant impaired in Eps8 binding, caused a readily detectable increase in Rac-GTP levels in wild type, but not in eps8 / fibroblasts (Fig. 5 C).Thus, the overexpression of E3b1 is sufficient to activate Rac and this effect is strictly dependent on Eps8 .The indispensability of E3b1 in the cascade of events leading to Rac activation and Rac-dependent actin reorganization was further analyzed at the biological level.We have previously shown that interference with E3b1 functions, by microinjection of anti-E3b1 antibodies, inhibited PDGF-induced ruffles (Scita et al. 1999).We also showed that in eps8 / cells, ruffling induced by PDGF and activated Ras, but not by activated Rac, was inhibited. Ruffling, however, could be restored upon reexpression of Eps8, but not of an Eps8 mutant unable to bind to E3b1 (Scita et al., 1999),suggesting that the Eps8?E3b1-based complex is implicated in the transmission of signal between Ras and Rac.Thus, one might predict that a mutant of E3b1 unable to associate to Eps8 should function as a dominant negative on Ras-induced Rac-dependent ruffling.To test this,we cotransfected the activated versions of either Ras or Rac, together with E3b1 or the E3b1DY mutant.RasV12-induced, but not RacQL-induced, ruffles wereefficiently inhibited by the coexpression of E3b1DY, but not of E3b1 wild type (Fig. 6),supporting the contention that the ability of E3b1 to form a complex with Eps8 is required to transmit signals from Ras to Rac.In conclusion, our data show that two pools of Sos-1 exist in the cell, coupled respectively to Grb2 or E3b1. In addition, the availability of E3b1, but not of Sos-1, is indispensable and rate limiting in the pathway leading to Rac activation.The existence of Sos-1 in two physically and functionally distinct pools suggests the hypothesis that its presence in a S/G or a S/E/E8 complex could dictate its Rasor Rac-specific GEF activities, respectively.To explore this possibility,we used an in vitro assay that can score GEF activities in Sos-1? containing immunoprecipitates. Cells were transfected witheither Sos-1 alone (SosTfx) or a combination of S/E/E8 (Triple Tfx) (Fig. 7 A).When Sos-1 was immunoprecipitated from SosTfx, it displayed Ras-GEF, but not Rac-GEF, activity (Fig. 7 B).Of note, little E3b1 and no Eps8 could be detected in Sos-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7 A). Conversely, Grb2 was readily recovered from the same immunoprecipitates (unpublished data).We then used the Triple Tfx and coimmunoprecipitated Sos-1 with anti-Eps8 antibodies (Fig. 7, A and B).Under these conditions, all of the coimmunoprecipitated Sos-1 is present in the S/E/E8 tricomplex (Scita et al., 1999).Despite lower levels of Sos-1 in the coimmunoprecipitate (with respect to a Sos-1 immunoprecipitate from SosTfx), Rac-GEF activity was now present (Fig. 7 B). Conversely, no Ras-GEF activity could be detected (Fig. 7 B).The lack of Ras-GEF activity was not due to the low levels of Sos-1.To prove this point,we immunoprecipitated from SosTfx an amount of Sos-1 comparable to that present in anti-Eps8 immunoprecipitates from Triple Tfx (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes SosTfx1/10).Under these conditions, Ras-GEF activity was readily detectable (Fig. 7 B).The detection of Rac-specific GEF activity in anti-Eps8 immunoprecipitates strictly required the presence of Sos-1,since no GEF activity was detected in Eps8 immunoprecipitates, in the absence of coexpressed Sos-1 (Scita et al., 1999 unpublished data).Furthermore, no Rac-GEF activity could be detected in Eps8 immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells transfected with Sos-1, E3b1, and an Eps8 mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind E3b1and thereby cannot form a trimeric complex (Scita et al., 1999).At this stage, we cannot formally exclude that an unknown GEF, coprecipitating with Sos-1, is responsible for the observed activity.However, such a hypothetical protein should not only be associated with Sos-1, but also be active only in the presence of Eps8 and E3b1,which are both required for the formation of the trimeric complex endowed with Rac-specific GEF activity (Scita et al., 1999),making this possibility unlikely.It is reasonable, therefore, to propose that Sos-1 alone (or complexed with proteins, such as Grb2) is endowed with Ras-GEF activity. However, upon interaction with Eps8 and E3b1, its specificity is switched toward Rac.A common feature of proteins endowed with GEF catalytic activity is their ability to bind to their specific nucleotide-depleted GTPase with relative high affinities.Thus, one might postulate that Sos-1 associates with the nucleotide-free form of Rac exclusively when engaged in the S/E/ E8 complex.Purified and nucleotide depleted, GST-Rac and GST-Cdc42 proteins were therefore used to test their ability to interact with Sos-1.Native Sos-1, present in lysates of / [Eps8myc] fibroblasts, could be specifically recovered with nucleotide-depleted immobilized GST-Rac, but not with GST-Cdc42 or GST alone (Fig. 7 C). Conversely, no Sos-1 could be recovered with GST-Rac from lysates ofeps8 / cells.Thus, Eps8 is required for the association between Sos-1 and nucleotide-free Rac.Furthermore, under conditions in which the Eps8?E3b1 or the E3b1?Sos-1 interactions were disrupted by specifically competing peptides, a reduction of 80% in the amount of Sos-1 bound to nucleotide-depleted Rac was observed (Fig. 7 C).This latter result strongly suggests that an intact S/E/E8 complex is required for binding to Rac, providing a molecular basis for the catalytic specificity of the complex.Since S/G and S/E complexes are present in the cells simultaneously, then both Sos-1-dependent Rasand Rac-GEF activities are present at the same time.The question remains as to how these two complexes, and the ensuing Ras and Rac activities, are coordinated to achieve propagation of signals.We therefore looked for evidence of differential regulation of the S/G and S/E complex upon RTK stimulation.
