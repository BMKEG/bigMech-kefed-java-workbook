Again when LKB1 WT and LKB1 KD were transfected the EGF treatment promoted the disassembly of the LKB1-AMPKα complex. However, GST-AMPKα did not form a complex with either the LKB1 S431A or LKB1 S431D mutants, suggesting that, in response to growth factors, the Ser428 residue would be involved in the binding or stability of the LKB1-AMPKα complexes ( Fig. 4B ). Figure 4 Growth factor treatment and BRAF V600E promotes LKB1-AMPKα disassembly.
