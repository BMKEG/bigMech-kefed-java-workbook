We searched for interaction(s) of the Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complex with class I PI3K. Endogenous p85 and Abi1 could be coimmunoprecipitated ( Fig. 1 A, left, and supplemental materials), and a wortmannin-sensitive (Fig S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200206079/DC1 ) PI3K enzymatic activity was detected in Abi1 immunocomplexes ( Fig. 1 A, right), suggesting that the p110–p85 complex binds to Abi1.
