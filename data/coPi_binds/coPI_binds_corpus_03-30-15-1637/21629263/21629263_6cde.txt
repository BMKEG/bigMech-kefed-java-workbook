By co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the acetyltransferase p300 was found to associate with TβRI ICD in vivo ( Fig. 6c,d ) and we used an acetyl-lysine antibody to verify that TβRI ICD is acetylated ( Fig. 6e ). In contrast, in cells expressing the E161A mutant TβRI, less ICD was associated with endogenous p300 and less acetylated ICD was detected ( Fig. 6d,e ). We observed that the level of p300 was lower in cells transfected with the E161A mutant TβRI unable to bind TRAF6, compared to wt TβRI ( Fig. 6d ).
