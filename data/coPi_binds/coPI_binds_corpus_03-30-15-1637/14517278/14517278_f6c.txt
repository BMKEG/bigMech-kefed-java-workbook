(c) Stable TLR4 YFP - or TLR3 YFP -expressing HELA cells were transfected with 4 Î¼g of plasmid encoding Flag-Mal, Flag-TRAM, or Flag TRAM-C113H. 48 h later, whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, and immunoprecipitated complexes were immunoblotted for Flag-tagged adapters. Western blotting of lysates demonstrates expression of stable TLRs and transfected adaptor proteins.
