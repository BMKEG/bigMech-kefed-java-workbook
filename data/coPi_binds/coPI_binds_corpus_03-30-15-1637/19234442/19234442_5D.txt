We tested a set of known nuclear proteins containing these domains for binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated H2AX ( Supplementary Table 1 , partial list) and found that, while most exhibited no interaction, the PTB-domain protein Fe65 [ 29 ], a co-factor for several cell-surface receptors that has been shown to translocate to the nucleus during DNA damage response and suggested to exert a pro-apoptotic role [ 30 , 31 ], bound specifically to wild type γH2AX under DNA damage conditions, but not to the γH2AX Y142F mutant ( Fig. 5d ).
