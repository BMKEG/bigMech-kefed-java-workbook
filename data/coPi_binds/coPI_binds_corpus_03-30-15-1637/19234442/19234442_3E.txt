Because Eya1 and Eya3 are seen to interact in 293T embryonic kidney cells both before and after treatment with ionizing radiation ( Fig. 3e ), we suspect that regulation of Eya3 via damage-dependent phosphorylation at serine 219 is one cue that may direct both Eya1 and Eya3 to Î³H2AX, indicating that these covalent modifications of H2AX and Eya may act as sensors for the DNA damage response pathway.
