Co-immunoprecipitation with immunoblotting studies of whole-cell lysates from Panc-1 cells showed that when EGFR is knockdown by siRNA ( Fig.1C(i) , upper band), Src immunecomplex remains associated with Stat3 ( Fig. 1C(i) , IP:Src), and vice-versa ( Fig. 1C(i) , IP:Stat3). Likewise, when Src is knockdown by siRNA ( Fig. 1C(ii) , upper band), EGFR immunecomplex remains associated with Stat3 ( Fig. 1C(ii) , IP:EGFR), and vice-versa ( Fig. 1C(ii) , IP:Stat3). Scrambled (con) siRNA has no effect.
