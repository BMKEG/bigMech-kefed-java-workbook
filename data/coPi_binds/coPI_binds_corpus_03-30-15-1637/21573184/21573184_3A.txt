Immunoblotting analysis of immunecomplexes of Stat3 (IP:Stat3), EGFR (IP:EGFR) or Src (IP:Src) prepared from nuclear extracts showed that the siRNA knockdown of Src ( Fig. 3A(i) , upper panel) has little effect on the association of Stat3 with EGFR in the nucleus ( Fig. 3A(i) , IP:Stat3, IP:EGFR), while similarly, the knockdown of EGFR ( Fig. 3A(ii) , upper panel) did not alter the binding of Stat3 to Src ( Fig. 3A(ii) , IP:Stat3, IP:Src). Scrambled (con) siRNA has no effect.
