By contrast, immunoblotting analysis of EGFR immunecomplex showed decreased levels of associated Stat3 protein, but not Src, when cells were treated with ZD, Das, or S3I-201 for 24 h ( Fig. 3B , lanes 4, 7, and 9). These findings together suggest the EGFR and Src kinase activities promote the association of Stat3 with EGFR in the nuclear heteromeric complex, while the inhibition of EGFR or Src kinase alone does not preclude the interaction between EGFR and Src.
