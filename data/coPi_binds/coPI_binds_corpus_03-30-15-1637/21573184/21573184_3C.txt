Immunoblotting analysis of Stat3 immunoprecipitates from nuclear extracts that have been pre-incubated with the three peptides for 2 h at room temperature showed no detectable EGFR protein ( Fig. 3C(i) ). These results suggest the EGFR-Stat3 interaction is promoted by pY1068EGFR and pY1086EGFR, and also that in binding to EGFR, Stat3 utilizes the key amino acid residues, 588â€“615 of its SH2 domain, which make up the peptide inhibitor SPI [29] .
