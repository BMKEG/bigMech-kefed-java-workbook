Furthermore, to make sure that our observation in CKR also is true in the context of non-chimeric VEGFR-2, we mutated Y1057 to F in the full length VEGFR-2, expressed in PAE cells and similarly analyzed for its ability to bind SH2 domain of c-Src. The result showed that VEGFR-2 associates with SH2-Src in VEGF-dependent manner and mutation of Y1057 inhibited association of VEGFR-2 with c-Src ( Figure 1K ). Altogether, the data show that Y1057 of VEGFR-2 is a major c-Src binding site on VEGFR-2 and its presence is critically required for VEGFR-2 to activate c-Src.
