A recent study indicates that tyrosine 1057 of VEGFR-2 also serves as a binding site for c-Cbl by directly interacting with its tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain [14] , raising an interesting possibility as to whether c-Cbl and c-Src competitively bind to Y1057 or c-Cbl acts to bridge c-Src to VEGFR-2 since c-Cbl is known to interact with c-Src via its SH3 domain [22] . To test these two distinct possibilities, we used PAE cells co-expressing CKR either with wild type c-Cbl or Cbl-N, where the TKB domain is deleted [14] and analyzed the ability of GST-SH2 domain of c-Src to interact with VEGFR-2. Over-expression of wild type c-Cbl enhanced association of SH2 domain of c-Src with VEGFR-2, where disabling the binding of c-Cbl with VEGFR-2 had no effect on the binding of SH2-Src to VEGFR-2 ( Figure 2A ).
