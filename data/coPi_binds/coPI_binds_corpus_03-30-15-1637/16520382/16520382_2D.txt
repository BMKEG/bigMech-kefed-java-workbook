Proteins of the shcA family are known to associate with grb2 via phosphotyrosine–SH2 interactions ( Rozakis-Adcock et al., 1993 ; Gotoh et al., 1996 ). To determine whether such interactions are important to p66shc-stimulated dissociation of sos1 from grb2, tyrosines 349, 350, and 427—the residues on p66shc that when phosphorylated mediate the recruitment of grb2—were mutated, and the capacity of this triple mutant (p66shcY3A) to displace sos1 from grb2 in vivo was examined. When compared with p66shcWT, p66shcY3A expression led to a decrease in displacement of sos1 from grb2 ( Fig. 2 D ). In addition, p66shcY3A bound less avidly to grb2 than p66shcWT ( Fig. 2 D ).
