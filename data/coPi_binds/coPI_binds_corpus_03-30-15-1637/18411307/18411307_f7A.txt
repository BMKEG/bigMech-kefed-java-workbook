(A) Disruption of the SDT sites progressively inhibits MDC1â€“NBS1 interaction. U2OS cells were transfected with the HA-tagged MDC1 fragments spanning the intact N terminus (WT) and its derivatives where the indicated residues were substituted to alanines. The 4A fragment combines alanine substitutions of Ser299, Thr301, Ser453, and Thr455. In the 12A fragment, all of the 12 potential CK2 sites within the SDT region were mutated to alanines. After 24 h, lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-NBS1 (top) and anti-HA (middle) antibodies. The immunoblotting of NBS1 from the whole cell extracts (bottom) validates an equal input of the lysate in each reaction. WCE, whole cell extract.
