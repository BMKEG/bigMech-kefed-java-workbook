(C) The N-terminal region of MDC1 spanning the first 500 amino acids efficiently interacts with cellular NBS1. The indicated HA-tagged fragments of the MDC1 N terminus were transfected into MDC1/shRNA cells (the numbers indicate the C-terminal amino acid of each fragment). After 24 h, lysates were prepared, subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody, and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to NBS1 (top) and HA (middle). The input into each reaction was controlled by NBS1 immunoblotting of the whole cell extracts as in A (bottom).
