(C) The SDT region is necessary for and sufficient to promote interaction of the MDC1 N terminus with NBS1. MDC1/shRNA cells were transfected with the HA-tagged MDC1 fragments described in B. After 24 h, lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and analyzed by immunoblotting with NBS1 (top) and HA (middle) antibodies. The bottom panel is an immunoblot of whole cell extracts and shows equal input of each NBS1 in each lane. WCE, whole cell extract.
