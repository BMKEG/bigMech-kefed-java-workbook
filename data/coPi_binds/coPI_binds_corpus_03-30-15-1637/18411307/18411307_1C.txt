Under these conditions, a fragment spanning the first 500 amino acids of MDC1 appeared to be necessary and sufficient to bind cellular NBS1 ( Fig. 1 C , lane 6), and this binding did not further increase after including the more C-terminal sequences ( Fig. 1 C , lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, although MDC1 also contains an FHA domain at the very N terminus, this domain (either isolated or in the context of a larger fragment spanning up to the first 200 amino acids of MDC1) appeared to be entirely dispensable for NBS1 interaction ( Fig. 1 C , lanes 1 and 2).
