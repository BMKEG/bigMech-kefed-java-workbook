(C) Total cellular lysates (10 mg) obtained from −/− [Eps8myc] cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the antibody indicated at the top (ctr, irrelevant antibody) in the presence or absence (−) of 40 ng/ml of the indicated peptides (peptides). The peptides used were PPPPPVD Y TEDEE (PXXDY) and PPPPPVD A TEDEE (PXXDA, used as a control). Immunoblotting was with the indicated antibodies (WB). The indicated lanes (lysates) were loaded with 100 μg of total cellular lysates.
