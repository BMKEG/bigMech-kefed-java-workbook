Upon PDGF stimulation, we observed decreased coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 and consequently between PDGFR and Sos-1 ( Fig. 8, A and B ), which correlated with the appearance of a mobility-retarded form of Sos-1. This likely represents a hyperphosphorylated form of Sos-1, as previously demonstrated ( Baltensperger et al., 1993 ; Cherniack et al., 1994 ; Pronk et al., 1994 ). Conversely, under identical conditions, the coimmunoprecipitation between E3b1 and Sos-1 was not affected ( Fig. 8 A).
