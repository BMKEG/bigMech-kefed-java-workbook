(A) Mouse embryo fibroblasts cells were treated with PDGF for 15 min (+) or mock treated (−). Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Grb2 (left) or anti-E3b1 (right) antibody and detected with anti–Sos-1 antibody (top) or anti-Grb2 (bottom, left), or anti-E3b1 (bottom, right). The indicated lanes (lysate) (50 μg) were detected with anti–Sos-1 antibody to show the mobility shift after PDGF stimulation. Similar results were obtained upon EGF stimulation in Cos-7 cells (not shown).
