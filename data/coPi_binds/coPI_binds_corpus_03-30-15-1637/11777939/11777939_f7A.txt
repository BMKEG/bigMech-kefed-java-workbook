(A) Cos-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for Sos-1 (SosTfx) or for Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 (TripleTfx) or with the corresponding empty vectors (mock). Total cellular lysates (100 Î¼g, left), or immunoprecipitates (IP, right) with the antibody indicated on the top (ctr, irrelevant antibody), were immunoblotted (WB) with the indicated antibody. 5 mg of total cellular lysates were used for the immunoprecipitations, except in the SosTfx 1/10 lanes, in which 0.5 mg were used.
