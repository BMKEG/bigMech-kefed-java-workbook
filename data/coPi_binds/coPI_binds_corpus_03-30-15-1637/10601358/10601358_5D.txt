To further corroborate the specificity of the association of IRF-4 with BCL-6 and Stat6, we also performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with either an anti–IRF-4 or an antiserum against a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) family member, p65. These assays were conducted on extracts from JY cells, which constitutively express p65 in the nucleus ( 49 ; Fig. 5 D). These experiments failed to detect an association of IRF-4 with p65.  These studies thus indicate that IRF-4 can interact with the Krüppel zinc finger transcriptional repressor, BCL-6, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, no such interaction is detected in cells (JY) that express high levels of CD23b, suggesting that the presence of BCL-6 affects the functional ability of IRF-4 to modulate CD23b transcription.
