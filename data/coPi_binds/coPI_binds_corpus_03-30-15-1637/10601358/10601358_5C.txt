We also subjected extracts from Ramos cells cultured with or without IL-4 to immunoprecipitation assays with either an anti–IRF-4 or anti–BCL-6 antiserum ( Fig. 5 C). This experiment demonstrated that IRF-4 and BCL-6 coimmunoprecipitated. Association of BCL-6 and IRF-4 was not affected by IL-4 treatment. Surprisingly, we did not detect increased levels of IRF-4 in our immunoprecipitations of IL-4– or CD40-treated extracts ( Fig. 3 B and Fig. 5 C), despite an induction of IRF-4 levels by these stimulations ( Fig. 4 ). We suspect that this may be due either to a limited ability of this antiserum to immunoprecipitate increasing amounts of IRF-4 or to the ability of IRF-4 upon IL-4–CD40 treatment to form alternative complexes that cannot be recognized by this antiserum.
