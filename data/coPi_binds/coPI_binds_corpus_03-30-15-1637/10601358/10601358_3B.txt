To confirm that the IRF-4–Stat6 interaction could occur in vivo, we used an anti–IRF-4 antiserum to immunoprecipitate extracts from Ramos cells stimulated with either anti-CD40 Ab, a control Ab, or IL-4. Consistent with our previous observations, presence of the Stat6 protein could be detected in the IRF-4 immunoprecipitates from both stimulated and unstimulated Ramos lysates ( Fig. 3 B, top). Similar results were also observed in JY cells. Stripping and reprobing of the filter with an anti–IRF-4 Ab ensured for equal loading of the immunoprecipitates ( Fig. 3 B, bottom). Consistent with recent studies, which have detected IRF-4 in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Riccardo Dalla-Favera, personal communication), the IRF-4–Stat6 association can occur in the absence of IL-4 stimulation. Interestingly, in both GST and coimmunoprecipitation experiments the IRF-4–Stat6 interaction appears to decrease upon stimulation of Ramos cells with the CD40 Ab.  Thus, our data indicate that IRF-4 is capable of specifically interacting with Stat6 both in vitro and in vivo.
